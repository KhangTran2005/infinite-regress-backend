We report on timing and single-pulse observations of 17 pulsars discovered at the Arecibo observatory. The highlights of our sample are the recycled pulsars J1829+2456, J1944+0907 and the drifting subpulses observed in PSR J0815+0939. For the double neutron star binary J1829+2456, in addition to improving upon our existing measurement of relativistic periastron advance, we have now measured the pulsar's spin period derivative. This new result sets an upper limit on the transverse speed of 120 km sFORMULA  and a lower limit on the characteristic age of 12.4 Gyr. From our measurement of proper motion of the isolated 5.2-ms pulsar J1944+0907, we infer a transverse speed of FORMULA   km sFORMULA . This is higher than that of any other isolated millisecond pulsar. An estimate of the speed, using interstellar scintillation, of FORMULA  km sFORMULA  indicates that the scattering medium along the line of sight is non-uniform. We discuss the drifting subpulses detected from three pulsars in the sample, in particular the remarkable drifting subpulse properties of the 645-ms pulsar J0815+0939. Drifting is observed in all four components of the pulse profile, with the sense of drift varying among the different components. This unusual `bi-drifting” behaviour challenges standard explanations of the drifting subpulse phenomenon.

Introduction
Since the first systematic pulsar survey using the Arecibo telescope {{cite:8bce49e9-ee5b-46dc-90ce-ec85646f73ef}}, {{cite:b585578a-9602-434b-a0e7-ba1f52bc313d}}, {{cite:883b126c-cd74-41eb-bf52-3b55def42afa}} which discovered the original double neutron star binary B1913+16 {{cite:b585578a-9602-434b-a0e7-ba1f52bc313d}}, there have been a number of searches carried out with this sensitive system (e.g. {{cite:87f6bcd5-1fe6-4a3c-807b-311a653b578d}}, {{cite:73dfad7f-8806-440b-bd59-5b6d38be059b}}). Timing of the pulsars discovered in these searches has provided a wealth of information, including the first evidence for the existence of gravitational radiation {{cite:3e784162-a39c-44a1-b6ea-8490a7b19aa3}}, {{cite:82859c56-75a1-4fe2-80f4-94f406abfa0e}} and the first extra-solar planetary system {{cite:59e32c2b-dde4-4f99-8bce-bc56d757b220}}.
Between 1994 and 1998 the telescope underwent a major upgrade, during which the receivers were parked on the meridian but observations could still be made as the sky drifted past. Pulsar surveys conducted in this drift-scan mode have resulted in the discovery of 130 pulsars {{cite:86a8f80e-f77c-4d80-b15c-bdf2ae0913fb}}, {{cite:51ad752e-e175-422a-ab0e-331b41dd1274}}, {{cite:76f1a001-34c4-4e45-9373-4638c5ec97ad}}, {{cite:b1ed8a32-1059-4b2a-9757-23193aa25aa8}}, {{cite:4f22a97c-a3f7-4307-86aa-5d597e1beb85}}, {{cite:3bc7bb56-b1b2-46fd-b5a1-04dc6d31debe}}, {{cite:8b1adaa3-bb3f-4b71-b2f5-cd60a3ec865d}}.
In this paper we report on timing and single-pulse observations of 17 pulsars discovered at Arecibo. Nine of the pulsars were discovered in our recent drift-scan searches {{cite:b5822b27-546c-4828-ae52-166e7b1d7e4a}}, {{cite:6a6839e7-f966-435c-978e-68a4b4151d1a}}, while the remainder were found in earlier surveys and have not been subjected to a follow-up campaign of timing observations {{cite:76f1a001-34c4-4e45-9373-4638c5ec97ad}}, {{cite:fd2a7811-cb64-4d67-8f73-af832835dcff}}, {{cite:7476e463-6af2-4d0b-adcd-2a80a5ef858c}}, {{cite:0af877c2-5b8d-48eb-8187-350909336fa8}}. We discuss the timing results including the proper motion of millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1944+0907 and an updated timing solution for the relativistic binary J1829+2456. We then describe the drifting subpulses seen in three of the pulsars, including J0815+0939. This unique pulsar shows drifting in all four components of its unusual pulse profile, with the subpulses in one component drifting in a different sense to the others.

Observations and Analysis
The observations presented here were carried out between February 1999 and March 2005 using the Arecibo telescope. Most of the observations used the 430-MHz Gregorian dome receiver, which has an average gain of 11 K JyFORMULA  and an average system temperature of 45 K, in combination with the Penn State Pulsar Machine (PSPM), a 128-channel analogue filterbank spectrometer {{cite:478ead43-19b8-42f6-b59f-8ca064366240}}. During the early stages of timing when the periods of the pulsars were not well determined, the PSPM was used in search mode. The PSPM samples incoming voltages from the telescope every FORMULA s over a bandwidth of 7.68 MHz. These data were then dedispersed by delaying successive channels in time corresponding to the nominal dispersion measure (DM) of each pulsar to produce time series which were subsequently folded to produce integrated pulse profiles. To confirm that the period was the fundamental rather than a harmonic, the data was folded at twice the period and the profile was checked. Once the period of each pulsar had been determined accurately, the timing mode of the PSPM was used. In timing mode the data in each frequency channel are folded on-line. The 128 individual profiles can then be dedispersed and summed to produce a single profile.
The first stage of timing analysis is to produce a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) profile to use as a template. Initially this was done by shifting the profile so the peak was at a phase of 0.5 before summing the profiles. The time of arrival (TOA) of each profile was then calculated by convolving the profile with the template and adding this offset to the start time of the observation. These TOAs were then analysed with the TEMPO software packagehttp://pulsar.princeton.edu/tempo to produce a preliminary phase-connected solution (where every rotation of the pulsar is accounted for) over the time-span of the observations. In most cases a simple spin down model with five free parameters (pulse phase, period, period derivative, right ascension, and declination) was used. For PSR J1944+0907 the proper motion is a significant effect and is included in the fit. The relativistic binary pulsar J1829+2456 requires an additional five classical and two relativistic parameters to produce a phase connected solution. For each pulsar the resulting ephemeris was used to predict the pulse phase of each profile. These were then aligned before they were summed to produce a better template which was subsequently used to generate new TOAs, weighted by S/N, which were analysed using TEMPO. This additional iteration often resulted in significant reduction of the root-mean-square observed minus model timing residual. With the exception of PSR J1917+0834, a single template was sufficient for the timing analysis. For J1917+0834, due to the short length of the integrations and long period of the pulsar, only a small number of pulses were summed causing the relative strengths of the two peaks in the profile to vary from observation to observation, a template for each mode was required to provide accurate TOAs in the initial stages.
Most of the previously published DM measurements were based on the original observations and so were poorly constrained. In December 2004 the pulsars were observed at 320, 327, 334 and 430 MHz using the PSPM. The TOAs produced were analysed using TEMPO by holding all the, now well constrained, parameters of the ephemeris constant and fitting for DM. This new value of DM was then used to dedisperse the data again and improve the template, TOAs and ultimately the ephemerides.
To calibrate the intensity scale of the pulse profiles, we followed the procedure described by Lorimer, Camilo & Xilouris (2002) and scaled each profile by the factor FORMULA  mJy, where FORMULA  is the total system noise temperature (K), FORMULA  is the DC offset of the profile (in PSPM counts) and FORMULA  is the antenna gain (K JyFORMULA ). Due to the design of the Arecibo telescope, both FORMULA  and FORMULA  are strong functions of zenith angle. This dependence is described analytically by Perillat (1999). The total system temperature also includes the background sky temperature contribution {{cite:a6aa142c-43d2-403a-afb3-70fb9aba98a9}}. The error is based on the standard deviation of the observed fluxes.

TABLE 
FIGURE 
In Fig. REF  we show the locations of the 17 pulsars on the period-period derivative (FORMULA -FORMULA ) diagram. As can be seen, the majority of the pulsars occupy the lower end of the `island' of points suggesting that they are relatively old members of the normal population. This is in keeping with previous samples of pulsars drawn from low-frequency surveys (e.g. {{cite:91945723-a619-4373-af90-2ab1f45ae63c}}) which are less effective at finding young pulsars than surveys at higher frequencies (e.g. {{cite:fbb46be2-fba0-4df9-aca8-533d916208eb}}).
PSR J1829+2456
This 41-ms pulsar is in a mildly eccentric binary system where the companion is most likely a neutron star {{cite:6a6839e7-f966-435c-978e-68a4b4151d1a}}. The rate of advance of periastron, FORMULA , is now measured to a significance of 180-FORMULA . Interpreting FORMULA  as purely relativistic precession implies that the total mass of the binary FORMULA  MFORMULA  (see Fig. REF ). The lower companion mass limit of 1.26 MFORMULA , and upper limit to the pulsar mass of 1.34 MFORMULA  are given by the constraint that the inclination angle FORMULA . A very conservative upper limit on the companion mass FORMULA  MFORMULA , and a minimum inclination angle FORMULA , can also be inferred. A more likely upper limit of FORMULA  MFORMULA  is obtained by assuming a minimum pulsar mass of 1.26 MFORMULA  (the lowest measured mass of any neutron star, namely PSR J0737FORMULA 3039B; {{cite:5c5c58cf-0f7a-4218-acc6-67d501d1e741}}). An upper limit of 8 ms can now also be placed on the relativistic time-dilation and gravitational redshift parameter, FORMULA , but, as shown in Fig. REF , this is not yet constraining. The determination of these limits is described in more detail in {{cite:6a6839e7-f966-435c-978e-68a4b4151d1a}}.
FIGURE 
The extended baseline of our TOAs has also resulted in a measurement of FORMULA  for this pulsar. However this FORMULA  should be treated with caution since any transverse component of proper motion of the system would lead to secular acceleration {{cite:f4b4ed67-e228-448a-acd6-18197a8d077d}}, {{cite:8eb310bf-5c84-4bea-9869-07adf96ae990}} and will contribute to the observed period derivative,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  contribution due to the proper motion, FORMULA  is the transverse speed and FORMULA  is the proper motion. Indeed, assuming the current measurement of FORMULA  is entirely due to proper motion, and adopting the nominal DM-derived distance of 1.2 kpc, the Shklovskii effect places an upper limit of 20 mas yrFORMULA  on the proper motion, corresponding to a transverse speed of FORMULA 118 km sFORMULA . This transverse speed is consistent with other double neutron star systems so it is possible that the intrinsic FORMULA  is considerably lower.
However if the FORMULA  of PSR J1829+2456 is assumed to be intrinsic it places this double neutron star system in an area of the FORMULA -FORMULA  diagram inhabited by various eccentric binary systems (see Fig. REF ). This FORMULA  implies a characteristic age of at least 12.4 Gyr and a magnetic field strength of FORMULA  G. As for other recycled pulsars this large characteristic age suggests that its birth spin period was comparable to its current spin period. Of the other double neutron star systems, only J1518+4904 has a lower FORMULA  {{cite:8e59966e-e39f-4436-800c-eeb8d90b1eb8}}. PSR J1829+2456 is currently the subject of an extended timing campaign to measure a proper motion and so remove any contribution of the Shklovskii effect from the measurement of FORMULA . Simulated TOAs suggest that a proper motion of 15 mas yrFORMULA  should be measured to FORMULA  and the expected FORMULA  (1.3 ms) should be measured to FORMULA  accuracy within the next year. Simulations also suggest that it would be possible to measure the Shapiro delay with the current observing equipment if the inclination was FORMULA .

PSR J1944+0907
PSR J1944+0907 is an isolated 5.2-ms pulsar with a broad profile {{cite:fc338da5-de7b-4152-aa74-8b880f83deb0}}. Isolated MSPs are rare objects; only 13 are currently known {{cite:2bf456ae-3b60-4b59-a6b9-e47d5304fc79}}. While binary MSPs are thought to be spun up by the accretion of matter from an evolved binary companion, the formation process for isolated MSPs is presently not clear. Either they form through a different formation channel (such as accretion-induced collapse), or they ablate their companion with their strong relativistic wind {{cite:c4c8fd26-bc30-48a5-9608-01ccc1a769e7}}. As shown in Fig. REF , the proper motion of this pulsar, FORMULA , is detected very significantly in our timing observations from which we obtain FORMULA  mas yrFORMULA . This would imply a transverse speed FORMULA  km sFORMULA ; this is significantly higher than the average for recycled systems (FORMULA , Hobbs et al. 2005) and, with the exception of PSR B1257+12 which has a planetary system, this is by far the highest of all isolated (and indeed most binary) MSPs so far {{cite:f7113fdf-d5c8-4c0a-845a-66f7dee7c283}}, {{cite:a239c544-60c2-4434-a8a4-d20c300ce19f}}, {{cite:4124fe8e-5d6c-4316-b530-fc05fed5f79a}}, {{cite:ba2bc013-0f09-48dd-a0e9-4e3f08222de0}}, {{cite:ca0a9f65-55fe-4b4a-8b15-5fed0a44a556}}, {{cite:8a017ac7-f64f-49d5-a0a0-466844527bc8}}, {{cite:b1ed8a32-1059-4b2a-9757-23193aa25aa8}}, {{cite:50514e9b-f94a-4d0c-912a-1ea4f54fde35}}, {{cite:4f22a97c-a3f7-4307-86aa-5d597e1beb85}}, {{cite:1bcc7459-3e52-4df7-8a3f-88a538b9f19e}}, {{cite:9eeb5b0e-760d-43ba-9bb9-d9e0108225e9}}.
FIGURE 
The very large transverse speed implied by the proper motion would have a significant effect on the observed FORMULA  as described in REF . When this Shklovskii effect is taken into account the intrinsic FORMULA  drops to FORMULA . This value has been used to calculate the derived parameters listed in Table REF .
PSR J1944+0907 also scintillates strongly at 430 MHz, as shown in Fig. REF . An auto-correlation analysis of its dynamic spectrum indicates a bandwidth and timescale of FORMULA  = 90 kHz and FORMULA  = 101 s. The interstellar scintillation derived transverse speed, FORMULA , is given by
FORMULA 
where the constant FORMULA  km sFORMULA  for a uniform Kolmogorov scattering medium, FORMULA  is the distance in kpc, FORMULA  is frequency in GHz, FORMULA  is scintillation bandwidth in MHz and FORMULA  is the scintillation timescale in seconds {{cite:49d04327-69ba-47ab-948c-402f1a4443a3}}. Assuming a distance of FORMULA  kpc, the implied transverse speed is FORMULA  km sFORMULA .
Because the transverse speeds inferred from proper motion and scintillation depend differently on the distance, we may use these measurements to calculate a distance consistent with both measurements. Assuming a uniform scattering medium, this distance is 3.6 kpc, with implied transverse speed of 340 km sFORMULA . Not only is this far higher than the transverse speeds measured for any isolated MSPs but would imply a Shklovskii correction greater than the observed FORMULA ! We therefore conclude that the scattering medium is not uniform and that the actual distance and speed are closer to 1.8 kpc and 188 km sFORMULA , respectively.
FIGURE 

Drifting Subpulse Behaviour
Single pulses often consist of several components, called subpulses, which change position, often drifting from pulse to pulse. This phenomenon was first reported by Drake & Craft (1968) and has since been recognised in roughly 100 radio pulsars (Weltevrede, Edwards & Stappers 2005). It is usually understood within the FORMULA  drift model of {{cite:fe37238c-3871-4f08-a649-c87ec98cf908}} in which radio emission comes from discrete locations, or “sub-beams”, positioned on a circle around the magnetic pole. The sub-beams rotate and move in and out of our line of sight. The Ruderman & Sutherland model has been fairly successful in explaining pulsar drifting patterns. In fact, for PSR B0943+10, {{cite:82e1d3d7-66ab-4cdd-a8d9-ad641acdb044}} have been able to determine that there are 20 sub-beams rotating around this pulsar's magnetic axis, with a rotation timescale close to 100 s.
In some cases our PSPM search-mode data were of sufficient quality to analyse individual pulses. In our sample three of the pulsars show drifting subpulses. The drifting can be characterised by the drift rate and two periods (FORMULA  and FORMULA ; {{cite:bee7beaf-6f1a-4c04-8768-f8959e27c9db}}). The drift rate is simply the longitude of pulse phase drifted by each subpulse per second. The separation in longitude between consecutive subpulses and the separation at a given longitude between successive subpulses are denoted by FORMULA  and FORMULA . The single pulses for the three pulsars are shown in Fig. REF  and the measured drift rate and FORMULA  for each pulsar are listed in Table REF ; FORMULA  is not applicable in these cases as there is never more than one subpulse (per component) visible during a single pulse. For PSR J0815+0939, FORMULA  was determined using a fluctuation spectrum analysis, in which a Fourier transform is applied to a series of single pulses (in this case 256) for a range of pulse longitudes.
TABLE 
FIGURE 
The single-pulse behaviour of the 645-ms pulsar J0815+0939 is remarkable. This pulsar's profile is unusual, consisting of four components with separations of 41, 58, and 54 ms and not easily described by standard phenomenological classification schemes {{cite:39c63c9b-675a-41de-8d51-32fb73ae3131}}. As shown in Fig. REF , drifting is observed within all four components. We refer to these (from left to right) as components I, II, III and IV. The drift within component I is difficult to measure and appears to change sense within an observation. The drift rates of components II, III and IV are very stable from epoch to epoch and do not appear to change sense. However, the drift sense of component II differs from those of components III and IV. While of opposite sign, the drift rates of components II and IV are equal within the errors, indicating a possible relationship. Measurements at 327 and 430 MHz indicate an evolution of the drift rate with frequency, with a higher drift rate at the lower frequency.
While drift sense reversals within a single component are quite common and are attributed to aliasing effects {{cite:b3e3f0e4-d592-4714-9eb4-193186e96ee1}}, it is rare for different components to show different drift senses (Hankins & Wolszczan 1987; Weltevrede et al. 2005). How do we interpret this strange behaviour? It is very difficult to reconcile with the standard Ruderman & Sutherland model in which sparks travel around a circular region centred on the pulsar's magnetic axis. In this case the four components would probably be associated with two nested hollow-cone beams. Similar drift sense would be expected in components I and IV and also II and III but this is not observed. This pulsar's “bi-drifting” behaviour has been geometrically modelled by {{cite:c56b59f9-35df-43bb-9f22-77a3c736db2c}}. While promising, this model is based on one short integration at one frequency. Edwards & Stappers (2003) interpret the behaviour of
B1918+19 as being due to multiple imaging of subbeam systems. Further studies are planned which will determine if there are any aliasing effects while polarisation measurements will help determine the relationship between the multiple components.
In addition to J0815+0939, both PSR J1916+0748 and PSR J2007+0912 show weak drifting as shown in Fig. REF . For J1916+0748, the broad integrated profile can be explained as the superposition of a series of drifting subpulses. Further studies of these pulsars with higher sensitivity and time resolution in future may well be worthwhile.

Conclusions
We have presented a timing and single-pulse study of a sample of 17 pulsars discovered with the Arecibo telescope. These observations provide new insights into a wide range of neutron star physics. We now briefly summarize the new results obtained from the present study.
Extending the timing baseline of the relativistic binary pulsar J1829+2456 presented by Champion et al. (2004) has allowed the mass of the system to be further constrained, FORMULA  MFORMULA , and an upper limit to be placed on the relativistic time-dilation and gravitational redshift parameter, FORMULA  ms. The measurement of FORMULA  has placed an upper limit on the proper motion, FORMULA 20 mas yrFORMULA , (using the Shklovskii effect) and a lower limit on the characteristic age, FORMULA  Gyr. Further timing will allow a measurement of this pulsar's proper motion and a determination of the intrinsic FORMULA . A measurement of the parallax through timing is less likely as the current level of precision.
The proper motion of PSR J1944+0939 has been measured and revealed the highest transverse speed of any isolated MSP, FORMULA  km sFORMULA . An alternative estimate of the speed using interstellar scintillation, FORMULA  km sFORMULA , demonstrates that the scattering medium along the line of sight is non-uniform. These measurements suggest that the space velocity of J1944+0939 is higher than for any other isolated MSP. Further timing observations will ultimately allow the parallax of this pulsar to be measured which will resolve current uncertainties in the transverse speed estimates.
The drifting observed in PSR 0815+0939 is very unusual and warrants further study. All four components of the pulse profile show drifting subpulse behaviour. Of the three components in which we see no drift sense reversals, one of the components has a different drift sense to the others. This is difficult to explain using the standard Ruderman & Sutherland model. Further observations, including polarimetry, are required to shed light on this remarkable pulsar and the implications it may have for emission mechanism models.
