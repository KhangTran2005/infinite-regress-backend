We propose a simplified scheme to teleport a superposition of coherent
states from one mode to another of the same bimodal lossy cavity. Based on
current experimental capabilities, we present a calculation of the fidelity  that can be achieved, demonstrating accurate teleportation if
the mean photon number of each mode is at most FORMULA . Our scheme applies as
well for teleportation of coherent states from one mode of a cavity to
another mode of a second cavity, both cavities embedded in a common
reservoir.

The teleportation phenomenon {{cite:33261c49-022d-49c2-ab82-b34e0966c780}} has received increasing
attention, and a number of protocols have been suggested for its
implementation in various contexts, for example running waves {{cite:203005e3-0e04-4673-83ef-2a3d23537d25}}, {{cite:f92e0eb3-1fe0-4411-ad89-45cd60c157ae}}
and cavity-QED {{cite:6e3bf9a5-985e-4531-9788-5e1466ce6f7d}}. Experimentally, teleportation has been
demonstrated for discrete variables {{cite:7bb7ed99-182e-452f-80c1-d968f61ba651}}, {{cite:b302687e-1ca6-4915-b37d-f899509830f0}}, {{cite:8047791f-e7d5-4da9-b6dd-a5757b61ae14}}, {{cite:7ee9d183-9c19-4ebf-9a24-75a650d748a8}}, {{cite:95c76ab6-3462-469b-844a-0a1ddbb53d2e}}, and
for a single mode of the electromagnetic field with continuous variables
{{cite:a84e926e-ae6f-4012-aac4-3591433c3db9}}, {{cite:76587d13-0887-48ce-86e6-22362cc197ff}}. More recently, teleportation between matter and light was
announced {{cite:f2d90bfb-f834-4fed-941a-bf8897e9379b}}, where matter and light are respectively the
stationary and flying media.
In the realm of cavity QED, schemes for teleportation of two-particle
entangled atomic states {{cite:7c0dd023-745a-42a0-969e-32ccfe1f8e11}}, multiparticle entangled atomic states and
also entangled field states inside highFORMULA  cavities {{cite:d6eafe25-867c-4348-94c3-7a6f0dd258b2}}, {{cite:03f51b25-e0ed-4762-a040-d6dd59c11904}}, {{cite:2878acac-15f6-4f50-a5f6-684d3e04a82f}}
have been proposed. Although these foregoing schemes using highFORMULA  cavities represent advances by simplifying the procedures required to
teleport states of cavity modes, all experiments implemented till now have
involved only a single highFORMULA  cavity, for reasons related to the complex
experimental challenges such as decoherence and the difficulty of
controlling the interactions. Nonetheless, the cavity is undoubtedly an
important scenario for testing fundamentals of quantum mechanics {{cite:91b538d1-a22b-4c85-8443-e8dc85ece7e9}} as well as for demonstrating quantum information processing
{{cite:2df57a19-71c9-41ba-9e8a-0b814286a056}}; hence experiments involving teleportation - the
cornerstone of universal quantum computation {{cite:177d8122-b99f-4535-9d7d-4408204110d9}} - are
expected to be reported soon in the context of highFORMULA  cavity. Aiming at
this goal, our group recently proposed a simplified scheme to teleport a
superposition of zero- and one-photon state {{cite:e98e46dd-7e87-4ff3-a743-9fbeaab88228}}, which makes use
of only a single bimodal highFORMULA  cavity, the teleportation occurring from
one mode to another inside the highFORMULA  cavity. Pursuing this idea, here we
propose an oversimplified scheme to teleport a trapped field state with
continuous spectra, the “Schrödinger
cat”-like state (SCS). The experimental setup is shown in
Fig.1. As in ref.{{cite:e98e46dd-7e87-4ff3-a743-9fbeaab88228}}, our scheme uses only one bimodal cavity,
supporting mode 1 and mode 2, and two two-level atoms, comprehending the
circular states FORMULA  and FORMULA , plus Ramsey zones and selective atomic state detectors. The Hamiltonian
including the required dispersive interaction between an atom and the
dissipating cavity field is FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  FORMULA  and FORMULA  are, respectively, the creation and
annihilation operators for the iFORMULA  cavity mode of frequency FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the analogous operators for the kFORMULA 
reservoir oscillator mode, whose corresponding frequency and coupling with
the mode FORMULA  are FORMULA  and FORMULA . The atom-field
coupling parameter FORMULA  will always be
adjusted to ensure FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the Rabi
frequency, FORMULA  is the atom-field interaction time, and FORMULA  is the detuning between the
field frequency FORMULA  and the atomic frequency FORMULA . The
evolution outside the cavity occurs with FORMULA . It is important to
note that the last term in Eq.(REF ) involving FORMULA  will be
effective only with one mode at a time. Thus, while the interaction of an
atom with mode 1 (2) of the cavity field is taking place, the relative
phase due to dispersive interaction of this atom with mode 2 (1) of the
cavity field will be negligible. This is true provided that the difference FORMULA  between the two modes be large enough. In addition, to simplify our
estimation of the fidelity of the teleported SCS, we will assume that the
atom-field coupling is turned on (off) suddenly at the instant the atom
enters (leaves) the cavity.
The evolution of coherent states governed by the Heisenberg equations
corresponding to Eqs.(REF -) are given in detail in Ref. {{cite:41283bfb-f632-4d2f-b5a9-f09792bcb686}}. Here, for brevity, we collect only the main results, assuming a
reservoir at absolute zero temperature, which is an excellent approximation{{cite:91b538d1-a22b-4c85-8443-e8dc85ece7e9}}. The results of interest for modes FORMULA  are
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
The FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA  as explained in Ref.{{cite:41283bfb-f632-4d2f-b5a9-f09792bcb686}}, are the damping rates
and the Lamb-shifts for the two modes, obtained through the Wigner-Weisskopf
approximation {{cite:52bae8b5-d1db-4ee0-a9bb-446f934fc219}} FORMULA ,FORMULA  and FORMULA  can be obtained from FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively, by simply swapping FORMULA  and FORMULA ; and FORMULA  is an unimportant function when the reservoir is kept at zero
temperature. Eqs.(REF -) can be further simplified by assuming
the following experimental parameters, in the microwave domain. For the
field mode damping times, FORMULA  and FORMULA , corresponding respectively to modes 1 and 2, whose frequencies obey the relation FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  can be adjusted in the range 100 FORMULA  to 2 FORMULA 
{{cite:952c21ec-a49c-4dc7-a852-c229bbe44e5a}}. The two-level atom must be prepared in such way that the
frequency FORMULA  of the atomic transition FORMULA , when the atom enters the cavity, be detuned from mode 1 by FORMULA  and fulfilling the condition FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the rate of spontaneous emission and FORMULA  is the mean photon number in mode 1. This condition thus
implies, for the detuning with mode 2, FORMULA . Experimentally, the atomic frequency can be Stark shifted using a
time-varying electric field to detune the atomic frequency with each mode
{{cite:952c21ec-a49c-4dc7-a852-c229bbe44e5a}} by the large amount FORMULA . As an example, let us
consider an experiment setup prepared obeying FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA . Then, the interaction with mode 2
(which we are assuming as possessing higher frequency), will be also
dispersive, and when the atom – mode 1 interaction produces a FORMULA  pulse,
the coherent state in mode two will evolve according to FORMULA  FORMULA , with FORMULA , which we take into account when calculating the fidelity. Further, we
can assume the cross-damping rates FORMULA  and FORMULA  taking
as maximum values those of each mode separately, i.e, FORMULA , FORMULA  {{cite:adc5cfcd-1cec-4507-99b1-77877889668e}}. With these assumptions and
taking into account the dispersive interaction in Eq.(REF ), Eqs.(REF )-() are simplified as following. FORMULA .
When the atom is out of or enters the cavity in the ground state, FORMULA  and FORMULA . When the atom is in the cavity
in the excited state, FORMULA  and FORMULA  when the
atom is interacting with mode 1; or FORMULA  and FORMULA  when the atom is interacting with mode 2. Here FORMULA , and therefore we have the
important result that the damping rate for each of the two modes is simply
the mean damping rate of the two modes.
Ideal process. The ideal SCS to be teleported is prepared by
injecting a coherent state FORMULA  into mode 2, assuming FORMULA  in Hamiltonian (). Then a two-level
atom 1 is laser-excited and rotated in FORMULA  to an arbitrary
superposition FORMULA . After that, the atom 1 crosses the cavity, having
being velocity-selected to interact off-resonantly with mode 2 such that FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the atom-field interaction time. The atom
1 then crosses FORMULA , undergoing a FORMULA  pulse, and is detected,
inducing a collapse of the cavity field to the even (FORMULA ) or odd (FORMULA ) SCS, FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are unknown coefficients
obeying FORMULA . The FORMULA  FORMULA  sign occurs if the atom 1 is detected in the state FORMULA  FORMULA . From now on let us suppose that the even SCS has been
prepared.
FIGURE 
The procedure to teleport the SCS is as follows. Firstly, the atom 2
crosses the Ramsey zone FORMULA , undergoing a FORMULA  pulse, as
shown in Fig.1, being rotated to the superposition FORMULA .
Assuming mode 1 has previously been prepared in the coherent state FORMULA , the whole state of the system is
FORMULA 
Next, atom 2 interacts off-resonantly with mode 1, such that FORMULA , resulting in:
FORMULA 
Soon after the atom 2 and mode 1 interaction, which leads to Eq.(REF ), the Stark shift is switched to a large detuned FORMULA , thus freezing the evolution corresponding to mode
1 and, at the same time, initiating the atom 2 and mode 2 interaction.
The result, after this interaction, is
FORMULA 
After crossing the bimodal cavity, atom 2 crosses the Ramsey zone RFORMULA  undergoing a FORMULA  pulse, such that Eq.(REF ) evolves
to
FORMULA 
Therefore, by detecting the atom 2 and measuring the phase of the field in
mode 2, the field state in mode 1 is projected on to one of the four
possibilities allowed by Eq.(REF ). Assuming atom 2 being detected in
its ground state, the phase of the field in mode 2 can be measured by
injecting a reference field of known amplitude FORMULA  into mode 2, which
makes the field states FORMULA  and FORMULA  in Eq.(REF ) evolve respectively to the
states FORMULA  and FORMULA . Such states can then easily be distinguished by sending a stream of
two-level atoms, all of them in the ground state FORMULA , to interact resonantly with mode 2 of the cavity field. Thus, if at
least one of these atoms are detected in their excited state FORMULA , indicating the result FORMULA  in Eq.(REF ), then mode 1 is
projected exactly on the desired state FORMULA , thus completing successfully the teleportation process.
On the other hand, if the measurement result is always FORMULA , indicating the result FORMULA  in Eq.(REF ), a second atom
interacting off-resonantly with mode 1 leads to FORMULA  FORMULA . For measurements revealing the states FORMULA  and FORMULA  in Eq.(REF ),
the teleportation process cannot be completed unless additional cavities
and/or atoms be introduced, thus overcomplicating the scheme. The
teleportation is accomplished provided we let FORMULA , and the
probability of success for the ideal case is then limited to FORMULA .
Real process. In real processes, the state FORMULA  to be teleported will evolve under the influence of the
reservoir, becoming a mixture FORMULA  after traced out the reservoir. To
estimate losses in teleportation, we have to compute i) the known value of
the reference field FORMULA  we have to inject in the cavity
in order to obtain FORMULA , as remarked
after Eq.(REF ), and ii) the fidelity FORMULA   of the teleported
SCS. To answer question i), we have to compute the evolution FORMULA  and then to trace out mode 1 and the infinite
modes of the reservoir, denoted by FORMULA , in order to obtain FORMULA . Again we quote the result in {{cite:41283bfb-f632-4d2f-b5a9-f09792bcb686}}: starting from the initial state FORMULA  we obtain FORMULA , where FORMULA , thus answering question i). Note that the
remarkable result that at zero temperature a coherent state loses excitation
coherently remains valid, even when more than one mode is considered. To
answer question ii), we need the evolution of the teleported ideal state FORMULA  in the presence of mode 2 and the
reservoir, i.e., we have to calculate the evolution of the
combined state FORMULA , and, after that, to trace out mode 2
the and reservoir. This calculation only differs from that in i) by the
second term. The result is the mixed SCS
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  means Hermitian conjugate, FORMULA  , andFORMULA  is the term responsible for
decoherence. It is important to note that while FORMULA  in step i) is the time
spent preparing SCS in mode 2, in step ii) FORMULA  is the time after the SCS
is teleported to mode 1. Restricting ourselves to the joint measurement
corresponding to FORMULA , which is the only result promptly leading to
teleportation without requiring additional unitary operations (see Eq.(REF )), in about 25% of the trials the final teleported state will be
exactly the original SCS provided that we let FORMULA .  According to {{cite:952c21ec-a49c-4dc7-a852-c229bbe44e5a}}, the time the atom spends inside the
cavity is FORMULA  FORMULA , while the total flight time in the experiment is
in the FORMULA  FORMULA  range, which implies an error around 12% when, as
usually is done, the time during which the atom interacts with the modes is
neglected. Our calculation, however, is more realistic, since it takes into
account the time the atom crosses the cavity.
In Fig. 2 we present the fidelity for the teleported SCS, calculated with
experimental parameters appropriate for present-day technology {{cite:69a3e4a0-8dbe-4376-ba8a-78e8ed562dbc}}, {{cite:2df57a19-71c9-41ba-9e8a-0b814286a056}}, {{cite:952c21ec-a49c-4dc7-a852-c229bbe44e5a}}. Although these experimental parameters
were quoted from experiments involving orthogonally polarized modes, the
experimental capabilities such as time-varying electric field for
controllable Stark shift, two-level Rydberg atoms, the value of the Rabi
frequency FORMULA , and so on are expected to work as well for non-orthogonally
polarized modes of a same cavity. For orthogonally polarized modes, apart
from a relative FORMULA  phase, each mode will couple with a different
reservoir, and the dynamical fidelity for the prepared and teleported SCS in
a given mode will depend solely on the presence of its corresponding
reservoir, being independent of the second reservoir as well as of the
excitation in the second mode {{cite:4e54a05a-d7f2-4529-aa0f-0baa263e8760}}. Also, our scheme applies as
well for teleportation of SCS from one mode of a cavity to another mode of a
second cavity, if both cavities are placed in the same reservoir. In this
last case our scheme will work irrespective of the difference FORMULA .
FIGURE 
Note from Fig.2 that a successful realization of the teleportation process
is obtained for FORMULA  ranging from FORMULA  to FORMULA . However, while for FORMULA  the fidelity remains around unity for all times, for FORMULA  the fidelity decays to around FORMULA  by the time teleportation is
completed, reaching the lowest value FORMULA  at long times, still a
significantly high value. For FORMULA  the fidelity of the SCS by the
time the teleportation is concluded is around FORMULA , higher than the
classical limit FORMULA , showing that the teleported SCS has not been
substantially degraded. On the other hand, our result shows that
teleportation fails for FORMULA  given current experimental
capabilities. Note that, although we have calculated a conditional fidelity,
i.e., the fidelity resulting from 25FORMULA  of the trials, it would be
possible to recover, from any of the measurement results, the original SCS
to be teleported, at the expense of introducing additional cavities and/or
atoms.  However, this procedure would demand considerable effort, in itself
decreasing the fidelity of the teleportation process and overcomplicating
the present protocol.
