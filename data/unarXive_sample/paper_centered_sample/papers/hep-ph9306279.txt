Abstract
We review some recent results and future prospects in the phenomenology
of Supersymmmetry. We discuss the searches for superpartner states,
the searches for Higgs bosons in the minimal SUSY model, and additional
parameter constraints arising in SUSY-GUT models.
Introduction
Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a vital element in present thinking about
fundamental particle physics. At this Conference it certainly needs no
formal introduction nor motivation; we simply emphasise here two
important aspects — it has perturbatively calculable consequences and
can be experimentally tested. This talk will be about the associated
phenomenology.
Experimental evidence for SUSY could come in various forms, such as

discovery of one or more superpartners,

discovery of a neutral Higgs boson with non-standard properties
and/or a charged Higgs boson,

discovery of FORMULA  decay,

discovery that dark matter consists of heavy neutral particles.

This talk will address areas (a) and (b) above. We shall discuss the
present status and future prospects of searches for superpartner
particles, searches for Higgs bosons in the minimal SUSY model (MSSM)
and additional parameter constraints that come from SUSY-GUT studies.
We leave other phenomenological topics like proton decay, dark matter,
FORMULA -parity breaking, etc., to other speakers.

Experimental SUSY Signatures
The MSSM conserves a multiplicative FORMULA -parity: FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  are spin, lepton number, baryon number. Standard
Model (SM) particles have FORMULA ; their superpartners have FORMULA . Hence heavy
sparticles must decay to lighter sparticles, while the lightest
sparticle (LSP) is stable. If the LSP has no strong or electromagnetic
interactions, as seems likely since it has defied detection for so long,
it will carry away “missing" energy and momentum — a vital SUSY
signature. The LSP will also be a candidate for cosmological dark matter;
this focuses extra interest on the FORMULA -conserving case.
Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) are essential for SUSY phenomenology to economize
parameters. A minimal set of GUT parameters with soft SUSY breaking consists of
the gauge and Yukawa couplings FORMULA  and FORMULA , the Higgs mixing mass
FORMULA , the common gaugino mass at the GUT scale FORMULA , the common scalar
mass at the GUT scale FORMULA , and two parameters FORMULA  that give trilinear and
bilinear scalar couplings. At the weak scale, the gauge couplings are
experimentally determined. The Higgs potential depends upon FORMULA  (at
tree level) and FORMULA  (at one loop). After minimizing
the Higgs potential and putting in the measured FORMULA  and fermion masses, there
remain 5 independent parameters, e.g. FORMULA .
Beside the SM gauge bosons and fermions, the MSSM spectrum contains Higgs
bosons FORMULA , gluinos FORMULA , squarks FORMULA , sleptons
FORMULA , charginos (FORMULA ; mixtures of winos and
charged higgsinos), neutralinos (FORMULA ; mixtures of zinos,
photinos and neutral higgsinos). An alternate notation is FORMULA 
for FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA . Figure 1
illustrates the evolution of the SUSY mass spectrum from the GUT
scale {{cite:d6174f76-9eea-45a3-adcf-0f7e1aae9acc}}, {{cite:c19da845-3c4d-4ee4-abaf-d2af50954e30}}. The running masses are plotted versus
FORMULA  and the physical value occurs approximately where the running mass
FORMULA  intersects the curve FORMULA . For the Higgs scalar FORMULA , the
mass-square becomes negative at low FORMULA  due to coupling to top; in this
region we have actually plotted FORMULA . Negative mass-square parameter is
essential for spontaneous symmetry-breaking; here it is achieved by radiative
effects. The running masses for the gauginos FORMULA  are
given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  labels the gauge symmetry; this applies before mixing with higgsinos
to obtain the chargino and neutralino mass eigenstates. In Fig. 1 the squarks
are heavier than the gluinos, but the opposite ordering FORMULA  is possible in other scenarios.
Sleptons, neutralinos and charginos are lighter than squarks and gluinos in
general.
The usual soft SUSY-breaking mechanisms preserve the
gauge coupling relations (unification) at FORMULA .
In order that SUSY cancellations shall take effect at low mass
scales as required, the SUSY mass parameters are expected to be
bounded by
FORMULA 

Fig. 1. Typical RGE results for spartner masses {{cite:d6174f76-9eea-45a3-adcf-0f7e1aae9acc}}.
The other parameter FORMULA  is effectively bounded by
FORMULA 
where the lower bound arises from consistency in GUT models and the
upper bound is a perturbative limit (following Ref. 3). Proton decay gives FORMULA  {{cite:67482ce5-4253-409d-bab8-ccef4c45d57a}}, {{cite:6ac4a29e-fe72-4f77-bdbd-04ec3732f30e}}.
At LEP I, sufficiently light SUSY particles would be produced
through their gauge couplings to the FORMULA . Direct searches for
SUSY particles at LEP give
FORMULA 
There are also indirect limits on FORMULA  decays to SUSY particles{{cite:7658ade9-40cb-4724-a21d-4f2f23ff16e8}},
FORMULA 
It is convenient to express the excluded regions in terms of
the parameters that determine the gaugino masses, i.e. in the
FORMULA  or FORMULA  plane: see Fig. 2.
Hadron colliders can explore much higher energy ranges, producing squarks and
gluinos strongly. At the Tevatron, with luminosity 25 pbFORMULA 
expected in 1993, about 100 events would be expected
for each of the channels FORMULA  and FORMULA  for
FORMULA  GeV, reaching well beyond the
LEP range{{cite:7658ade9-40cb-4724-a21d-4f2f23ff16e8}}, {{cite:dbc4054f-a6a2-4078-89f8-3bb88386f8e9}}, {{cite:a5d0742d-4426-44aa-9c8e-25b59e2c4534}}.
SUSY particle signatures depend on their decays.
The most distinctive is the missing
energy and momentum of the undetected LSP (usually
assumed to be the lightest neutralino FORMULA ) in
all SUSY decay chains with FORMULA -parity conservation. At hadron colliders
one can only do book-keeping on the missing transverse
momentum denoted FORMULA /FORMULA / FORMULATFORMULA /pT FORMULA

from Ref. 7. Solid curves surround
regions excluded by LEP I data, dot-dashed curves show the potential
reach of LEP II, and the dashed curve is the Tevatron CDF limit for
FORMULA .If squarks and gluinos are rather light (FORMULA  GeV), their dominant decay mechanisms are strong decays to each other or
decays to the LSP:
FORMULA 
In these cases the LSPs carry a substantial fraction of the available
energy and FORMULA /FORMULA / FORMULATFORMULA pFORMULA pFORMULA s = 640FORMULA s = 1.8 FORMULA FORMULA FORMULA
For heavier gluinos and squarks, many new decay channels are open,
such as decays into the heavier gauginos:
FORMULA 
Some decays go via loops (e.g. FORMULA ; we have not
attempted an exhaustive listing here.
Figure 3 shows how gluino-to-heavy-gaugino branching fractions increase
with FORMULA  in a particular example
(with FORMULA ) {{cite:0c301df1-adc5-458a-ba9e-954ef7dc7dda}}.

Fig. 3. Example of gluino decay branchings versus mass {{cite:0c301df1-adc5-458a-ba9e-954ef7dc7dda}}.
The heavier gauginos then decay too:
FORMULA 
Here it is understood that final FORMULA  or FORMULA  may be off-shell and
materialize as fermion-antifermion pairs; also FORMULA  may be replaced
by FORMULA . In practice, chargino decays are usually dominated by
FORMULA -exchange transitions; neutralino decays are often dominated
by sfermion exchanges because the FORMULA 
coupling is small. To combine the complicated production and cascade
possibilities systematically, all these channels have been incorporated in
the ISAJET 7.0 Monte Carlo package called ISASUSY {{cite:2fa5d926-2181-4081-8015-e3ac06e6117c}}.
These multibranch cascade decays lead to higher-multiplicity final
states in which the LSPs FORMULA  carry a much smaller share of the
available energy, so FORMULA /FORMULA / FORMULATFORMULA /pTFORMULA WFORMULA Z FORMULAFORMULA bFORMULA cFORMULA /pTFORMULA /pTFORMULA (mg, mq) FORMULA

parameters {{cite:a5d0742d-4426-44aa-9c8e-25b59e2c4534}}, {{cite:dcac3567-db9f-4cfb-b737-be8352a0f08a}}. Cascade decays also present new opportunities for SUSY detection.
Same-sign dileptons (SSD) are a very interesting signal {{cite:c45d422e-e2ea-4395-a18f-e843e750d53b}}, which
arises naturally from FORMULA  and FORMULA  decays
because of the Majorana character of gluinos, with very
little background. Figure 5 gives an example.
Eqs. (REF )–(REF ) show how a heavy gluino or squark
can decay to a chargino
FORMULA  and hence, via a real or virtual FORMULA , to an isolated charged
lepton. If a gluino is
present it can decay equally into either sign of chargino and lepton
because it is a Majorana fermion. Hence FORMULA  or
FORMULA  systems can decay to isolated SSD plus jets plus
FORMULA /FORMULA / FORMULATFORMULA qqFORMULA ZiFORMULA Zi FORMULA

Fig. 6. Same-sign dilepton signals at the Tevatron {{cite:e5985831-b815-44ec-8827-6935218fad0b}}.
Genuinely isolated SSD backgrounds come from the production of FORMULA  or
FORMULA  or FORMULA  (e.g. FORMULA  by gluon exchange), with cross
sections of order FORMULA  or FORMULA  or
FORMULA  compared to FORMULA  for gluino pair production,
so we expect to control them with suitable cuts. Very large FORMULA 
production gives SSD via semileptonic FORMULA -decays plus FORMULA -FORMULA  mixing, and
also via combined FORMULA  and FORMULA  decays, but both leptons are produced in jets and can be suppressed by
stringent isolation criteria. Also FORMULA  gives SSD via FORMULA  and FORMULA , but the latter lepton is
non-isolated.
So SSD provide a promising SUSY signature.
The Tevatron can also search for trileptons{{cite:0c4decb1-361e-4efd-b6d2-3d518669a6d4}}, {{cite:a4a46943-5627-4764-ac76-0efa2492ea4a}}, arising
for example from
FORMULA .
Figure 7 shows predicted trilepton rates at the Tevatron for both
the minimal SU(5) and no-scale flipped SU(5) supergravity models;{{cite:a4a46943-5627-4764-ac76-0efa2492ea4a}}
the flipped SU(5) model tends to give the bigger
values.
Gluino production rates at SSC/LHC are much higher than at the Tevatron. At
FORMULA  TeV, the cross section is
FORMULA 
Many different SUSY signals have been evaluated, including
FORMULA /FORMULA / FORMULAT + n FORMULA /pT +FORMULA /pT + n FORMULA /pT + FORMULA + ZFORMULA /pT + ZFORMULA /pT + Z + ZFORMULA g gFORMULA mg FORMULA
Sufficiently heavy gluinos can also decay copiously to
FORMULA -quarks {{cite:a5d0742d-4426-44aa-9c8e-25b59e2c4534}}, {{cite:6ffe177f-7d65-4193-a3b4-b39e2e433142}}:
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  decay leads to multiple FORMULA  production. For a
gluino of mass 1.5 TeV, the FORMULA  branching
fractions are typically of order 30%, 30%,

6%, 6%, respectively. Figure 9 illustrates SSC cross sections for multi-FORMULA 
production via gluino pair
decays (assuming FORMULA ). We see that
for FORMULA  TeV the SUSY rate for FORMULA  production can greatly
exceed the dominant SM FORMULA  mode, offering yet another signal for
SUSY {{cite:6ffe177f-7d65-4193-a3b4-b39e2e433142}}.

To summarize this section:

Experimental SUSY particle searches have hitherto been based
largely on FORMULA /FORMULA / FORMULATFORMULA mg, mq
> 50FORMULA /pT FORMULA

For even heavier squarks and gluinos, the cascade decays dominate
completely and provide further exotic (multi-FORMULA  and multi-lepton)
signatures, which will be pursued at the SSC and LHC.
They would find spectacular events, containing several hard jets from the
primary decay plus many hard isolated leptons (FORMULA –FORMULA 
events per year with 3–4 such leptons), sometimes having
multiple FORMULA  and FORMULA  hadrons in the chain, with little conventional
background.

Gluinos and squarks in the expected mass range
will not escape detection.


SUSY Higgs Phenomenology
In minimal SUSY, two Higgs doublets FORMULA  and FORMULA  are needed to cancel
anomalies and at the same time give masses to both up- and down-type
quarks{{cite:0d109ede-6830-4b72-8b62-54443d4598e5}}. Their vevs are FORMULA  and FORMULA  where
FORMULA  GeV is the SM vev and FORMULA  parameterizes their ratio
(FORMULA ). There are therefore 5 physical scalar states: FORMULA 
and FORMULA  (neutral CP-even with FORMULA ), FORMULA  (neutral CP-odd) and FORMULA . At
tree level the scalar masses and couplings and an FORMULA -FORMULA  mixing angle FORMULA 
are all determined by two parameters, conveniently chosen to be FORMULA  and
FORMULA . At tree level the masses obey FORMULA .
Radiative corrections can be big, however {{cite:ecf4c1fc-b4d4-40bb-bbc5-d01431eb8439}}. The most important new
parameters entering here are the FORMULA  and FORMULA  masses; we neglect for
simplicity some other parameters related to squark mixing. One-loop corrections
give FORMULA  and FORMULA  mass shifts of order FORMULA , arising from incomplete cancellation of FORMULA  and FORMULA  loops. The
FORMULA  and FORMULA  mass bounds get shifted up and for the typical case FORMULA  GeV,
FORMULA  TeV (which we usually assume) we get
FORMULA 
There are also corrections to cubic FORMULA  couplings, to FORMULA -FORMULA 
mixing, and smaller corrections to the FORMULA  mass. Figure 10 illustrates the
dependence of FORMULA  and FORMULA  on FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Fig. 10. FORMULA  and FORMULA  mass contours in the FORMULA  plane for (a) FORMULA  GeV and (b) FORMULA  GeV, with FORMULA  TeV.In the next-to-minimal SUSY model (NMSSM), one Higgs singlet is added{{cite:0d109ede-6830-4b72-8b62-54443d4598e5}}
giving 7 bosons FORMULA , with
6 parameters at tree level (because there are now more terms in the
general scalar potential). This leads to a richer mass spectrum with
looser limits. It is instructive to see what happens to the upper
bound on the lightest scalar mass FORMULA , as constraints on the Higgs sector,
the gauge sector and fermion sector are progressively relaxed while
requiring perturbativity up to scale FORMULA  GeV and a SUSY
scale of order FORMULA  TeV {{cite:60b1a6c0-dbe5-4802-b4fc-c615b769fb5a}}:
FORMULA 
What are the constraints on the principal parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA ?

Perturbativity. This condition is a bit subjective. Requiring
the FORMULA  couplings to be less than FORMULA 
gives FORMULA  {{cite:7a8a9594-0175-427c-af2d-71e8fc7a57f8}}.
Requiring instead (two-loop)/(one-loop)FORMULA  in the renormalization
group equations (RGE) gives FORMULA  {{cite:58cade09-a97a-4fad-a803-2ddcc605b156}}.

Proton decay. Some models require FORMULA –15 {{cite:67482ce5-4253-409d-bab8-ccef4c45d57a}},
but a more conservative limit is FORMULA  {{cite:6ac4a29e-fe72-4f77-bdbd-04ec3732f30e}}.

SUSY-GUT models {{cite:d6174f76-9eea-45a3-adcf-0f7e1aae9acc}}, {{cite:c19da845-3c4d-4ee4-abaf-d2af50954e30}}, {{cite:58cade09-a97a-4fad-a803-2ddcc605b156}}, {{cite:a4a46943-5627-4764-ac76-0efa2492ea4a}}, {{cite:62b1f29a-7715-4fbb-a16a-242c40a295a6}} find solutions
in the range FORMULA  (with the upper bound
from perturbativity).

At LEP I, all four experiments {{cite:0713d65f-2abe-4bb9-b120-1080b90b5e90}} have searched for the processes
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  plus FORMULA  and FORMULA  decay
modes. The absence of signals excludes regions of the FORMULA  plane
FORMULA 
Null searches for FORMULA  also exclude a region with
FORMULA  {{cite:d1cb2d7d-7f12-43c4-8d1d-1413113d5767}}.

Global electroweak analysis with MSSM{{cite:1eeeb2c9-f280-411f-b79a-2216f1e92f4d}} prefers FORMULA a few
100 GeV, but without much statistical weight.

To cancel divergences and to remain within the GUT scale,
FORMULA –2 GeV. Combining (a)–(f), there is a general consensus that
FORMULA 

There is also indirect evidence from various quarters:

The measured FORMULA  branching fraction{{cite:4b3410b0-6fb7-478c-a77c-8dad7d67e2f8}} is
not far from the SM pred-iction and constrains possible virtual FORMULA 
contributions, giving{{cite:6cfc806d-3e5e-4687-9203-2616e51a9c59}} FORMULA (1 GeV); this is weaker than
Eqs. (REF )–() however.

The experimental bound{{cite:cb1fb414-f6ec-44b4-ab45-676397d859bc}} FORMULA 
is close to the SM prediction, based on FORMULA  loop calculations, setting
stringent limits on non-SM contributions. If just FORMULA  loops are
added, an important part of the FORMULA  plane is excluded{{cite:a246a23f-19f6-48bd-bf64-f9059a826443}}.
However, if spartners are relatively light, additional
FORMULA  loops may contribute significantly with either
sign{{cite:3c77b7ab-a329-47e7-ab08-56b33406e9fd}}. We need more information about the SUSY spectrum
to exploit this bound.

Future direct searches for MSSM Higgs bosons rely on future colliders
(apart from marginal improvements at LEP I as higher luminosity accumulates).
Several groups{{cite:da444bc5-328d-4bcd-a776-96d41daeb5f8}}, {{cite:8b4e9076-432a-4cf2-a9be-fc89d80cb7bb}}, {{cite:d84562c1-2b2a-4edc-bdfe-3ad053b9325a}}, {{cite:2de17471-4e43-40a0-937e-362f3fa4dff6}} have studied the prospects
for discovering the different bosons at LEP II and SSC/LHC; their results
broadly agree.
LEP II will have higher energy FORMULA  GeV, and should be
able to discover FORMULA  through the range FORMULA  GeV, but will not be
able to cover the full range of possible FORMULA . FORMULA  might be light enough
to discover, but FORMULA  and FORMULA  are likely to be too heavy. The parameter
sector where both FORMULA  GeV and FORMULA  will not be
accessible — i.e. will give no LEP II Higgs signals for FORMULA  GeV.
Searches for neutral scalars at SSC and LHC will primarily be analogous to SM
Higgs searches (see Figs. 11–13):

untagged FORMULA  signals from FORMULA  via
top quark loops;

lepton-tagged FORMULA  signals from FORMULA 
plus associated FORMULA  or FORMULA , with leptons from FORMULA  or
FORMULA  decays;

“gold-plated” four-lepton signals from FORMULA  or
FORMULA .

Though qualitatively similar to SM signals, these will generally be smaller due
to the different couplings that depend on FORMULA  and FORMULA .

signals.

signals.

signals.
For charged Higgs scalars, the only copious hadroproduction source is top
production with FORMULA  decay (that requires FORMULA ). The
subsequent FORMULA  decays are most readily detected in the
FORMULA  channel (favored for FORMULA ), with FORMULA  decay
(Fig. 14).

Fig. 14. Typical diagram for FORMULA  signals from top decay via
charged-Higgs modes.
SM FORMULA -decays give equal probabilities for FORMULA  leptons via FORMULA , but the non-standard FORMULA  leads to
characteristic excess of FORMULA . The strategy is to tag one top quark via
standard FORMULA  decay and to study the FORMULA  ratio in the
associated top quark decay (FORMULA  or FORMULA ).
New non-SM complications must now be taken into account, however,
especially for the neutral MSSM Higgs boson signals. New decay channels
open in addition to the main SM modes FORMULA  and FORMULA  (and also FORMULA 
via loops).

Firstly there are decays to other Higgs scalars, FORMULA  or FORMULA  or FORMULA ; the regions where these channels are
open are shown in Fig. 15, for FORMULA  GeV. In particular FORMULA  is
allowed and generally dominates (suppressing all the usual SM signatures)
everywhere except in the shaded region or near the line of coupling zeros
labelled FORMULA . We already mentioned FORMULA  in passing; it changes the
FORMULA  signals in a small region of the LEP I searches.

Fig. 15. Allowed regions for decays to other Higgses{{cite:2de17471-4e43-40a0-937e-362f3fa4dff6}}.

Secondly, there are decays to SUSY particles, especially the invisible
mode FORMULA ; these have usually been ignored but
could be significant{{cite:885812e4-dc25-4c84-a3d5-a3c1a994be9b}}. They could give new signals
and they could suppress old signals. Figure 16 shows contours of FORMULA  versus FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
the region excluded by LEP I SUSY searches being shaded (see Section 2);
there are small regions where SUSY modes could rise to 70%–90%, severely
suppressing standard FORMULA  signals, but they are within the reach of LEP II SUSY
searches (dashed lines) so we shall know. Here we shall mostly ignore SUSY
modes, arguing that they may dilute other Higgs signals but will probably not
efface them.

Returning to MSSM Higgs searches at SSC/LHC{{cite:da444bc5-328d-4bcd-a776-96d41daeb5f8}}, {{cite:8b4e9076-432a-4cf2-a9be-fc89d80cb7bb}}, {{cite:d84562c1-2b2a-4edc-bdfe-3ad053b9325a}}, {{cite:2de17471-4e43-40a0-937e-362f3fa4dff6}},
Figs. 17(a) and 17(b) show typical limits of detectability for untagged and
lepton-tagged FORMULA  signals at SSC, assuming luminosities FORMULA  (two years of running) and FORMULA  GeV. Figure 17(c)
shows a similar limit for the FORMULA  search (no FORMULA  signal is
detectable). Figure 17(d) shows typical limits for detecting the FORMULA excess FORMULA  signal; here the value of FORMULA  is critical, since only
the range FORMULA  can contribute at all. Putting all these discovery
regions together with the LEP I and LEP II regions, we see that very
considerable coverage of the FORMULA  plane can be expected — but
there still remains a small inaccessible region; see Fig. 18.
For FORMULA  GeV the inaccessible region is larger, for FORMULA  GeV it is
smaller.

FORMULA  GeV from Ref. 33; similar results are obtained by other groups {{cite:da444bc5-328d-4bcd-a776-96d41daeb5f8}}, {{cite:8b4e9076-432a-4cf2-a9be-fc89d80cb7bb}}, {{cite:d84562c1-2b2a-4edc-bdfe-3ad053b9325a}}.Emphasizing first the positive side, Fig. 19 shows how many of the MSSM scalars
FORMULA  would be detectable, in various regions of the FORMULA 
plane. In many regions two or more different scalars could be discovered, but
for large FORMULA  only FORMULA  would be discoverable; in the latter region, the FORMULA 
couplings all reduce to SM couplings, the other scalars become very heavy and
approximately degenerate, and the MSSM essentially behaves like the SM.

Fig. 19. How many MSSM Higgs bosons may be discovered (from Ref. 33).
Turning now to the negative side of Fig. 18, the inaccessible region,
Fig. 20 shows that different groups broadly agree on the boundary.
This region corresponds to intermediate masses for all Higgses:
FORMULA –115 GeV, FORMULA –160 GeV, FORMULA –160 GeV,
FORMULA –160 GeV. Why are none detectable? What went wrong?
It seems we are just unlucky here: the FORMULA  and FORMULA 
couplings that control FORMULA  become weaker; the FORMULA 
coupling that controls both FORMULA  production and two-photon decay gets
weak; FORMULA  competition suppresses the FORMULA  signals; FORMULA  is too
heavy and FORMULA  is suppressed. Next, is there any indirect way to
exclude this inaccessible region? One possibility is to understand
and exploit the FORMULA  bound better: see above. We note also
that if FORMULA  GeV (instead of 150 GeV as in Fig. 18), the region is
much smaller. Another possibility is to derive stronger parameter
constraints from SUSY-GUT models, as we now discuss.

Fig. 20. Different groups agree about inaccessible region.
In minimal SUSY-GUT models with FORMULA  TeV, the RGE
have a solution dominated by the infrared fixed point of the top
Yukawa coupling  FORMULA{{cite:bfec3e97-d60a-40b6-9f43-3f19452970bd}}.
For large FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is plausibly large at the GUT scale FORMULA , in which case
it evolves rapidly toward an infrared fixed point at low mass
scales{{cite:58cade09-a97a-4fad-a803-2ddcc605b156}}, {{cite:62b1f29a-7715-4fbb-a16a-242c40a295a6}}, {{cite:bfec3e97-d60a-40b6-9f43-3f19452970bd}}, {{cite:49c123b8-a070-49e2-ab8d-346a558e16e7}}, {{cite:f3f66501-1ac4-44d7-8b87-cb82927bbc40}}, {{cite:1081648a-932c-4f0b-acdb-00253a82034c}}, according to
the one-loop renormalization group equation
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA . Thus FORMULA  evolves toward a fixed
point close to
where the quantity in square brackets in Eq. (REF ) vanishes.
Then the known gauge couplings determine the running
mass FORMULA  and hence the pole mass
FORMULA ; two-loop
evaluations{{cite:58cade09-a97a-4fad-a803-2ddcc605b156}} give
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  is below the fixed point, its convergence to the fixed
point is more gradual and Eq. (REF ) does not necessarily apply.
But in practice large FORMULA  is favored in many SUSY-GUT solutions;
large FORMULA  facilitates FORMULA 
Yukawa unification{{cite:bb587fe0-6ecc-4f6c-85b8-4476d672602f}} and allows intricate relationships between fermion
masses and mixings. It is therefore interesting to pursue the phenomenological
implication of Eq. (REF ) {{cite:73c87471-7a88-40e8-971f-068267dce47e}}.
Figure 21 shows how FORMULA  and FORMULA  values
relate to FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in SUSY-GUT solutions with Yukawa unification; the lower (upper)
shaded
branches contains the FORMULA  fixed-point solutions. There is a small
region at the upper right where both fixed point solutions are simultaneously
satisfied. Figure 22 shows that
the FORMULA  fixed-point behavior is insensitive to GUT threshold corrections
FORMULA  in the FORMULA  ratio. The
sensitivity of the fixed point to threshold corrections is decreased
for larger values of FORMULA  where the solutions tend to have a
stronger fixed point character, as indicated by Eq. (REF ). The
perturbative limits of the Yukawa couplings near their Landau poles are
shown in Fig. 22(a) as the dashed lines FORMULA  and
FORMULA .

FORMULA 
at the GUT scale in the (FORMULA ) plane,
obtained from solutions to the RGE with
FORMULA  unification imposed.
The GUT scale Yukawa coupling contours are close together for
large FORMULA . The
fixed points describe the values of the Yukawa couplings at
the electroweak scale for FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Fig. 22: RGE results for
FORMULA  with the boundary condition FORMULA 
GeV.
(a) GUT threshold corrections to Yukawa coupling unification.
The solutions strongly exhibit
a fixed point nature, for threshold
corrections FORMULA .
Taking a larger supersymmetric threshold FORMULA 
or increasing FORMULA 
moves the curves to the right, so that the fixed point condition becomes
stronger.
(b) Evolution of the top quark Yukawa coupling for
FORMULA . The dashed line indicates
FORMULA  which gives an
approximation to the electroweak scale value of FORMULA  with accuracy of
order 10%.There are immediate implications for phenomenology{{cite:73c87471-7a88-40e8-971f-068267dce47e}}. If
FORMULA  GeV, Eq. (REF ) constrains
FORMULA  to values near 1, where FORMULA  is relatively light (recall the
tree-level relation FORMULA ) and the couplings of FORMULA  are close
to those of a Standard Model Higgs boson.
LEP Higgs searches{{cite:0713d65f-2abe-4bb9-b120-1080b90b5e90}}, {{cite:23138d88-e343-4e2d-815c-3f86d88023e7}} exclude a region of the
FORMULA  plane shown in Fig. 23(a): this translates to forbidden
regions in FORMULA  in Fig. 23(b). We see that the fixed-point
condition
predicts FORMULA  GeV, FORMULA  GeV, FORMULA  GeV; correspondingly
FORMULA  GeV, FORMULA  GeV. If in fact FORMULA  GeV, then
FORMULA  GeV as shown in Fig. 23, and FORMULA  will be discoverable at LEP II
(but none of the
other Higgs bosons will). The discovery limits at SSC/LHC (taken here from
Ref. 33) are shown in Fig. 24; we see that each of the five Higgs bosons might be
discoverable there, but not all at once, and possibly none of them at all.

Fig. 23: FORMULA  fixed-point solution regions allowed by
the LEP I data: (a) in the FORMULA  plane, (b) in the FORMULA  plane. The top quark masses are FORMULA , correlated to
FORMULA  by Eq. (REF ).Fig. 24: SSC/LHC signal detectability regions,
compared with the LEP I allowed region of FORMULA  fixed-point solutions from
Fig. 3(a) and the
probable reach of LEP II. The top quark masses are FORMULA .Finally we may ask what a future FORMULA  collider could do. We have seen that
part of the MSSM parameter space is inaccessible to FORMULA  collisions at
FORMULA  GeV, FORMULA , for FORMULA  GeV and FORMULA  TeV. But a possible future linear collider with higher energy and
luminosity could in principle cover the full parameter space. In is interesting
to know what are the minimum FORMULA  and FORMULA  requirements for complete coverage,
for given FORMULA . This question was answered in Ref. 42, based on the conservative assumption that only the channels
FORMULA  would be searched, with no special
tagging. The results are shown in Fig. 25. We have estimated that including all
FORMULA  and FORMULA  decay channels plus
efficient FORMULA -tagging could increase the net signal FORMULA  by a factor 6 and the
net background FORMULA  by a factor 4, approximately; this would increase the
statistical significance FORMULA  by a factor 3 and hence reduce the
luminosity requirement by a factor 9 or so. In this optimistic scenario, the
luminosity scale in Fig. 25 would be reduced by an order of magnitude.

Fig. 25. Minimal requirements for a “no-lose” MSSM
Higgs search at a future FORMULA  collider based on FORMULA  signals
alone. Curves of minimal FORMULA  pairings are shown for FORMULA , 150,
200 GeV; the no-lose region for FORMULA  GeV is unshaded {{cite:fbd4d25f-bf1d-4afc-a92e-2124d7742b84}}.To summarize this Section:

The MSSM Higgs spectrum is richer but in some ways more elusive than the
SM case.

At least one light scalar is expected.

As FORMULA  this light scalar behaves like the SM scalar while the
others become heavy and degenerate.

LEP I, LEP II and SSC/LHC will give extensive but not quite complete
coverage of the MSSM parameter space.

For some parameter regions, several different scalars are detectable, but
usually one or more remain undetectable.

The FORMULA  bound has the potential to exclude large areas of
parameter space (possibly including the inaccessible region) but is presently
subject to some uncertainty.

A higher-energy FORMULA  collider could cover the whole MSSM parameter
space, discovering at least the lightest scalar FORMULA .

FORMULA  fixed-point solutions in SUSY-GUT
models are theoretically attractive and also
strongly constrain the phenomenology; they
predict FORMULA  GeV; if FORMULA 
GeV, they exclude the inaccessible region and
predict that FORMULA  will be discovered at LEP.
