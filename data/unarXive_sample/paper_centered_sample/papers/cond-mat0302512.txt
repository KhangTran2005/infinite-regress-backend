Effects of anticipatory driving in a traffic flow model

Anticipation in traffic means that drivers
estimate their leaders' velocities for future timesteps. In the
article a specific stochastic car–following model with non–unique
flow–density relation is investigated with respect to anticipatory
driving. It is realized by next–nearest–neighbour interaction
which leads to large flows and short temporal headways. The
underlying mechanism that causes these effects is explained
by the headways of the cars which organize in an
alternating structure with a short headway following a long one,
thereby producing a strong anti-correlation in the gaps or in the
headways of subsequent cars. For the investigated model the
corresponding time headway distributions display the short headways
observed in reality. Even though these effects are discussed for a
specific model, the mechanism described is in general present in
any traffic flow models that work with anticipation.

Introduction
The basic mechanisms that are responsible for traffic flow breakdown
are still not very well understood and discussed controversial
{{cite:9725e40e-af35-4e40-bdd0-164f7d185bda}}, {{cite:c083d736-0b27-4590-b483-1417246db70d}}, {{cite:bce4880a-e4c9-4901-b51b-a292773e60b0}}, {{cite:ef76eb3e-4c79-4c82-937b-d0691630cd6f}}. One reason for it is, that the
microscopic models in use nowadays still have deficiencies, however it is not
obvious which ones. Therefore it is not clear whether the mechanisms
of breakdown displayed by a certain model have a counterpart in
reality.
Sometimes, even the inner working of those models is not very well
understood. This is true, e.g., for the models that work with
so-called anticipation {{cite:8c0677bc-416c-46a8-9190-85b48ebab55b}}, {{cite:794f757a-0d7e-4801-86eb-68b54b92aa14}}. Here, anticipation means
that drivers estimate the velocity of preceding cars for future time
steps. With respect to safe car motion this driving strategy avoids
abrupt braking and therefore leads to a stabilization of the flow in
dense traffic {{cite:8c0677bc-416c-46a8-9190-85b48ebab55b}}. As a result, these models display
small temporal headways that are similar to the ones observed in
reality. Although the mechanism of stabilization of the flow
seems to be necessary with respect to the reproduction of real–world
traffic data {{cite:8621cfc5-f3c7-4ce8-bdac-ac6706823b4a}}, the changes in the model's dynamics in
consequence of anticipatory driving are not known in detail.
Therefore, it is the aim of this article to clarify the role of
anticipation in microscopic traffic flow models.
This will be done for a certain well–known microscopic traffic flow
model which is described in section . In this model,
anticipation is introduced via next–nearest–neighbour
interaction. The consequences on the model's dynamics is explored by
simulation as well as analytical calculations
(cf. section ). Leaping ahead, it is stated that by virtue
of anticipation the system organizes the headways of the cars in an
alternating structure which allows for the observed small temporal
headways. As will become clear from the discussion, most of the results
found in the following should be at work in other models, too.

A car–following model with anticipation
As stated above, the effects of anticipation will be investigated
using a specific car following–model. The model described in
{{cite:6b4d7cad-5350-4d53-82d3-ff7ab53ae610}}, {{cite:d63f9077-20d6-4544-8e90-8f3e2cf437d4}}, {{cite:491cfec9-c44e-45d6-9352-8d6925ea76c9}} is used as reference model and is
referred to as SKM in the following.
It is based on an approach by Gipps {{cite:e71c93c3-e3ed-4b50-bae2-6692c727c651}} and three basic
assumptions, namely

that vehicles move collision–free,

not faster than a maximum velocity FORMULA  and

individual car acceleration FORMULA  and deceleration FORMULA  are
bounded.

Based on the requirement of collision–freeness a safety–condition
can be derived. Assume one car (driver–vehicle unit)
with velocity FORMULA  is following another car
(driving with velocity FORMULA ) within a distance FORMULA . Here, FORMULA 
is the free space between vehicles, i.e., the distance between the
cars at positions FORMULA , FORMULA  minus the cars' length
FORMULA . Safety, i.e., crash–free motion is guaranteed if
FORMULA 
holds, with FORMULA  being the braking distance needed to stop when
driving with velocity FORMULA  and FORMULA  a finite reaction time.
For braking with constant deceleration FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA 
the braking distance is given by FORMULA . The
equation (REF ) then leads to
FORMULA 
In order to complete the definition of the model's dynamics it is
assumed that every car moves at the highest velocity compatible with the
assumptions. Based on these assumptions an update scheme can be
formulated in the manner of the well–known Nagel–Schreckenberg model
(NaSch) {{cite:96e437ec-acd7-4080-b0d0-f2fe1be1b673}}.
FIGURE 
The SKM is defined with continuous state variables FORMULA  and
discrete timesteps FORMULA . In each timestep every car is updated
after calculating its FORMULA  according to the following scheme
FORMULA 
The update (REF ) is done in parallel. The random
fluctuation of strength FORMULA  is introduced to mimic
deviations from the optimal driving strategy given by FORMULA . FORMULA  is
a random number uniformly distributed in the interval FORMULA  and the
parameter FORMULA  determines the fluctuation strength in units
of FORMULA .
Before introducing anticipation into the model it should be
stated that the formulation of FORMULA  in equation (REF ) differs
from that given in {{cite:d63f9077-20d6-4544-8e90-8f3e2cf437d4}}. The reason is mostly that the
calculation of the update scheme (REF ) becomes more
easy. However, due to its structure we could not
find a proof for crash-freeness analytically (as is possible for the
original formulation). But extensive simulations with FORMULA  This conditions simply states that safe driving is
possible, if the “true” reaction time, i.e., one timestep, is
smaller or equal to the reaction time each driver assumes. neither
gave a hint for collisions nor had we found a crucial difference in
the model's dynamics.
We recall that in the SKM each car only takes into account the
car in front to deduce its optimal driving strategy. It is common experience that such assumption is unrealistic, especially in
dense traffic situations. In order to bring anticipation into the
model the update scheme is modified by an intermediate step: Each
driver predicts the worst–case strategy FORMULA  her predecessor will
choose in the next timestep. Assuming that there is a car in front of
the predecessor within a distance FORMULA  driving with velocity
FORMULA  (see figure REF ), then
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
The calculated FORMULA  will then be used to determine the safe velocity.
Therefore, the safety condition equation (REF ) is
restated with the assumption that the leading car will choose
FORMULA  as driving strategy,
FORMULA 
The function FORMULA  has been introduced to take into
account “unexpected” fluctuations in the predecessor's driving
behaviour. Then, the new expression equation (REF ) leads
to a new expression for the safe velocity,
FORMULA 
In the following,
FORMULA 
will be chosen where FORMULA  is constant. Since
FORMULA  can be interpreted as an effective gap
FORMULA , where equation (REF ) forces FORMULA .
The idea of the effective gap is similar to the
cellular–automaton model in {{cite:8c0677bc-416c-46a8-9190-85b48ebab55b}} (BL–CA).
The major difference is that in the modified SKM anticipation
enters into the model by velocity and the effective gap
(cf. equation (REF )) while in the
BL–CA it does just via the latter.
Besides the new definition of FORMULA  the update scheme
(REF ) is used.

The role of anticipation
FIGURE 
In this section, by means of computer simulations, the SKM with
anticipation (SKA) will be compared to the original model. For this
purpose, a fixed set of parameters is used, namely
FORMULA 
As time scale FORMULA  is chosen.
With respect to these parameters jam formation (wide moving jams) and
stable high-flow states exist in the corresponding SKM {{cite:d63f9077-20d6-4544-8e90-8f3e2cf437d4}}, {{cite:130d7248-7273-4d56-bced-bd8d88486d9b}} (cf. following subsection).
Flow–density relation
To get started both models were simulated using periodic boundary
conditions, i.e., on a one-lane loop. In order to measure the
flow-density relation the loop was initialized homogeneously at
different global densities. After relaxation of the system mean
density FORMULA , mean velocity FORMULA  and
flow FORMULA  were measured at a fixed location using
FORMULA  intervals for sampling. The local density for a car FORMULA 
passing the counting location is defined as
FORMULA 
Comparing the flow-density relations of the models
(figure REF ) they both display a high-flow state and a
capacity drop at intermediate densities. The latter indicates
slow-to-start behaviour. Note that there is no explicit rule
introducing this effect and it results from
the the asymmetry in the randomization process for small speeds.
As can be seen, this mechanism is not changed by the introduction of
next-nearest-neighbour interactions. Moreover, the "optimized" driving
strategy even leads to a stabilization of the high-flow branch towards
higher densities compared to the SKM as already stated.
In the closed system the jam state co–exists with the free–flow
state for densities FORMULA . Time-series at a fixed
density in that regime therefore display free-flow and jammed states
alternately (figure REF ). At densities where the
homogeneous free-flow state is unstable, small clusters of cars are
generated due to intrinsic fluctuations. In the long run, this number
of jams decreases until only one jam is left (figure REF ).
Recalling the arguments of {{cite:d63f9077-20d6-4544-8e90-8f3e2cf437d4}} the jamming transition in the
SKA is a phase transition and one finds a
phase-separated system at equilibrium using periodic boundary
conditions.
FIGURE 
In {{cite:130d7248-7273-4d56-bced-bd8d88486d9b}} a classification for stochastic traffic flow models is
provided based on the breakdown mechanism. To be more precise, in the
density regime where the jam solution co–exists with the high–flow
state one distinguishes two classes. Models are said to have a
“stable outflow” if intrinsic fluctuations are not able to trigger
the transition from homogeneous flow to the congested phase. With
respect to the chosen parameters, the SKM belongs to that class of
models. In contrast, models like the VDR-model {{cite:8291de8b-b2c1-4b01-a626-0e447340c72a}} display
real metastability in that density regime and are said to have
“unstable outflow”. In figure REF  the waiting time
until the first stopped car is found is
shown versus the
system's density. For each run a system with 5000 cars was initialised
homogeneously. The values presented are means of 20 realisation per
density. As can be seen, at FORMULA  this time
diverges, i.e., homogeneous states corresponding to FORMULA 
are stable. These state correspond to the high-flow branch in
the flow-density relation (figure REF ) and therefore , the
SKA owns the same type of bistability {{cite:130d7248-7273-4d56-bced-bd8d88486d9b}} as the SKM does.
FIGURE 
By virtue of the anticipatory driving strategy, the maximum attainable
flow in the SKA is unrealistically high, which is a known
feature for some extensions of the NaSch–model as well{{cite:8621cfc5-f3c7-4ce8-bdac-ac6706823b4a}}.
In that case the
high flows only occur, if anticipatory driving as
defined in {{cite:8c0677bc-416c-46a8-9190-85b48ebab55b}} is switched on in, e.g. the VDR–model
{{cite:8291de8b-b2c1-4b01-a626-0e447340c72a}}, without changing the model's parameters.
Even though such states only appear for special initial conditions,
i.e., highly ordered homogeneous configurations, modifications are
necessary to use it in reasonable applications. However, it is a
different question whether these flows can be attained in a realistic
settings with macroscopic disturbances from lane-changing, on- and
off-ramps etc. Additionally, by introducing a diversified driver
behaviour also might lower the maximum flow to realistic values. For
example this might be done is by using a distribution FORMULA 
for the parameter FORMULA  so that each driver has her individual
FORMULA  drawn from that distribution. Another way of doing it
is to increase
FORMULA . Nevertheless, we will not take into account such problem
since we concentrate
at discussing the effects of anticipatory driving on
the SKM.
Apart from these unrealistic high flows, it can be concluded that the
all–over macroscopic properties of the SKA under periodic boundary
conditions (i.e., the global fundamental diagram, the spontaneous jam
formation or the existence of compact jams) are similar to the
corresponding SKM.

Time–headway distribution
Several empirical studies have analyzed single vehicle data from
counting loops {{cite:b9ec6035-4538-44b8-b2f2-32481edecfa4}}, {{cite:6d04f2d7-096e-4fb5-a783-d8924154636e}}, {{cite:2ffc0138-e0c8-4005-b97f-886803555139}}, {{cite:ec36114d-a139-4cf4-9471-28e8bda7bc59}}, {{cite:355e5242-ef3a-4e3f-ad31-9772b28ea932}}. Such measurements
provide information about the microscopic structure of traffic
streams. The investigation of the corresponding observables in
stochastic traffic flow models can therefore justify their quality.
FIGURE 
The time-headway is the microscopic analogue of the inverse flow. In
real data, it is simply measured by the time-difference FORMULA  between the times of two cars passing the observer. Since this
model has a time-step of FORMULA , a different approach has
to be used to measure the time headway between two cars. This is
done by using the relation
FORMULA 
The closed loop still serves as the computer-experimental setup. It is
initialized at different densities and the time-headway distribution
is measured after a sufficient relaxation time.
In figure REF  the time-headway distribution of the free
flow phase at different densities is presented. From empirical
investigation it is known that
in free flow extremely small time-headways exist (FORMULA ). Moreover, the maximum of the distribution and its shape at
short times are independent of the density {{cite:2ffc0138-e0c8-4005-b97f-886803555139}}, {{cite:ec36114d-a139-4cf4-9471-28e8bda7bc59}}, {{cite:355e5242-ef3a-4e3f-ad31-9772b28ea932}}.
Figure REF  (top) shows that the original SKM is not able to
reproduce such small time-headways in the free flow phase. There
exist a sharp cut-off at FORMULA , i.e.,
the model's dynamics leads to FORMULA .
The maximum of the distributions is
located at FORMULA . Since in free flow FORMULA  this corresponds to FORMULA , i.e., the SKM owns a fix point in its dynamics (for more
details see next subsection)
In contrast, the time-headway distribution of the SKA shows a
broader peak structure (figure REF  (bottom)) and headways
noticeable smaller than FORMULA  exist, just as in empirical
observations. Even more, the distribution at short times is
independent of the density.
However, the broadness of the peaks is not found in real–world
observations.
The occurrence of short time-headways stems
from the introduction of the velocity anticipation. Drivers can
optimize their gap to the leading vehicle since they have an idea
about its future behaviour.
Smaller gaps at FORMULA  than in the SKM are therefore
allowed.
Moreover, the broadness of the peaks indicates that in the SKA a
range of gaps can be taken by cars driving at FORMULA  in the
free flow phase, i.e., there is no such strong fixed–point in the
car-following dynamics as is in the SKM (leaping ahead, this results
from the fact that in the SKA two consecutive cars share their
common gap FORMULA ). With increasing density the peak in the
distribution becomes more and more pronounced and is shifted towards
smaller time-headways. The position of the peak correspond to the mean
gap, given by the initial conditions, FORMULA . Moving towards higher densities along the
free-flow branch of the flow–density relation the possible range of
gaps between cars decreases.
Comparing the time-headway distributions in the congested state
(figure REF ), they are for both models almost independent of
the density. The exponential decay of the distribution results from
the fact that for large headways cars can be regarded as almost
independent from each other, implying a Poissonian distribution.
They have their maximum around FORMULA  which agrees with
empirical findings. Unlike reality the peak is fixed and not as broad.
From this we conclude that concerning the dynamics inside jams both
models behave similarly.
The appearance of FORMULA  in the case of the SKA is due to the
experimental setup. In the closed loop the system is separated into
two phases, one wide moving jam and a region of free-flow
(figure REF ). As demonstrated before, time–headways smaller
than FORMULA  can be found in the free–flow phase. Therefore, cars that
are not in the jammed state generate these time-headways. Since the
number of cars in the free phase decreases with increasing density the
weight of small time–headways also reduces.
FIGURE 

Optimal velocity curve
Neglecting fluctuations, the optimal velocity curve (OVC) of both
models can be derived analytically. This relation is helpful in order
to characterize the microscopic structure of the traffic phases
{{cite:2ffc0138-e0c8-4005-b97f-886803555139}}, {{cite:ec36114d-a139-4cf4-9471-28e8bda7bc59}}, {{cite:355e5242-ef3a-4e3f-ad31-9772b28ea932}}.
FIGURE 
The OVC of the SKM results from its safety-condition
(REF ), i.e.
FORMULA 
Equation (REF ) is solved by FORMULA , therefore the OVC
of the SKM reads
FORMULA 
From equation (REF ) it follows that FORMULA  for the
deterministic case. The OVC asserts the results that time-headways
smaller than FORMULA  can not be modeled by the SKM since FORMULA  is required due to safety constraints and the
stochasticity leads to a lowering of FORMULA .
Regarding the SKA two cases have to be distinguished (cf.
equation (REF )). The OVC is derived from the condition
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
.
In the case of FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA , equation (REF ) is
solved by FORMULA  and the OVC reads
FORMULA 
If FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA  the known expression of
the SKM follows,
FORMULA 
Therefore, in the high density regime, the SKA behaves like the SKM as already stated with respect to the flow-density relation.

Follow–the–leader behaviour
Finally, we investigate the differences in the follow–the–leader behaviour between
the two models. For this purpose we use a chain of 1000 cars
that follow the first car whose speed is fixed to
FORMULA . The system is initialized by all cars
standing (FORMULA ). The zeroth car accelerates until the
constant velocity FORMULA  is reached.
Since then the system can be assumed to be stationary,
quantities start to be measured once for the last car of the chain
FORMULA . Before
presenting the
simulation results this set-up will be analysed more closely.
FIGURE 
In the following just the deterministic case will be regarded. Then,
all the speeds can be eliminated to yield an update equation just for
the gaps. In order to keep the equations concise we adopt the
following notation: If a quantity is labeled with a prime FORMULA  it
means timestep FORMULA , all others are to be taken at timestep
FORMULA . For the same reason FORMULA  is used in the following.
Assuming a lead car driving at constant speed FORMULA , the
behaviour of the SKM is then determined by the
equations
FORMULA 
Equation (REF ) has a fixed-point at FORMULA  and FORMULA . Since this result can be expanded to the full chain of cars it
follows that
FORMULA 
The lower index denotes the position FORMULA  of the car in the chain.
The result explains the independence of the peak in the time–headway
distribution at low densities (cf. figure REF ). Moreover, it
follows that the stochasticity of the SKM is not able to destroy the
fixed–point entirely. It is worth to say that the robustness of the
fixed–point in continuous car–following models is hard to overcome
and causes problems to model the synchronized state.
Now, the same situation is investigated for the SKA. Again, the lead
car drives constantly with FORMULA  which is also FORMULA  for the first
following car. Regarding the deterministic case, that car then
drives with FORMULA  and with constant headway FORMULA . This is because
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
whose fixed–point FORMULA  is just
FORMULA .
For the second car this procedure can be carried out to give
FORMULA 
where the stationary state of the first car FORMULA  and
FORMULA  has been assumed. This equation has a simple
fixed–point, namely FORMULA . Obviously FORMULA  holds
alike.
For the third car the computation leads to
FORMULA 
and FORMULA . Generalized, the latter
equation reads
FORMULA 
leading to the following expression for the stationary state
FORMULA , FORMULA :
FORMULA 
FIGURE 
This result, equation (REF ), shows that asymptotically the gaps of
the FORMULA –th
and FORMULA –th car are anti-correlated. In figure REF  time
series FORMULA  vs. FORMULA  are displayed for different values of
FORMULA . With increasing FORMULA  the corresponding line moves away from
the origin, therefore the corresponding flow decreases.
The result helps to understand the plateau structure found in the
time–headway distribution of the SKA at low densities
(cf. figure REF ). With respect to equation (REF ) the
time–headways of two consecutive cars cover the boundary–points of
the interval FORMULA . Compared to the distribution of time
headways measured in simulation the lower bound will hardly be reached
due to stochasticity in the latter case.
As in the SKM stochasticity is not able to destroy
the fixed–point structure of the model, but two cars can exchange
their role in that structure, i.e., two cars share a gap given by mean
density but the share between FORMULA  and FORMULA  is not
fixed. Figure REF  displays a time series of two cars sharing a
common gap.
FIGURE 
Before the correlation structure of the models is investigated in more
detail, the role of FORMULA  is shown. Looking at equation (REF )
one could wonder why the anticorrelation does not lead to states with
FORMULA .
Assume that a car FORMULA  has closed in on its predecessor
FORMULA . Recalling equation (REF ), the gap FORMULA  develops as
FORMULA 
Setting FORMULA  and FORMULA  the following approximation
of FORMULA  holds,
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Equation (REF ) shows, that once FORMULA , FORMULA  tends to
zero, but is finally stopped at FORMULA . A car that starts with FORMULA 
is drawn towards FORMULA , which is the fixed-point. Therefore,
setting FORMULA  safe driving can not be assured. This will get even
more clear if one determines the minimal gap that occurs over the full
range of densities dependent on the stochastic noise strength
FORMULA  and FORMULA , cf. figure REF .
On the one hand, it can be seen clearly that the minimal gap found
increases with increasing FORMULA . On the other hand, the dependence on
FORMULA  is not so explicit. This results from the fact, that
FORMULA  does enter the model two–fold. Once, it acts similar as in
the SKM (cf. equation (REF )) but it also determines FORMULA .
With respect to the crash–free motion it can nevertheless been stated
that there is always a minimal FORMULA  which assures safe driving
if FORMULA  is chosen. But, the value of FORMULA 
depends on the system parameters in a complicated way. It has to be
determined by simulation.
A closer look at the correlation function between two arbitrary
observables FORMULA  and FORMULA  at car FORMULA , FORMULA  respectively,
FORMULA 
finally explains the effects of anticipation on the system's state. In
equation (REF ) FORMULA  stands for the standard deviation of
observable FORMULA  taken at car FORMULA .
FIGURE 
In figure REF  the correlation functions FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are shown. In contrast to the SKMIn SKM FORMULA . The same holds for FORMULA .
there exist a platoon of cars behind the leading car which display a
strong anticorrelation between two consecutive gaps, cf.
equation (REF ). Note, that this structure is not destroyed if the
lead car also drives stochastically around FORMULA . In the regime of strong anticorrelation FORMULA  a car is somehow free to choose a gap FORMULA  independent of the speed
of the leading car. Therefore, this state reminds one of synchronized
flow{{cite:9725e40e-af35-4e40-bdd0-164f7d185bda}}, {{cite:c9de1166-65b4-4536-b9c2-212233845677}}, {{cite:1ce62f3e-7044-4c41-86d5-61686e4e3845}}, {{cite:1a01ec2f-f545-4c7c-becc-d4aa68d57ad6}}, a traffic state that mostly occurs at
bottlenecks. However, further exploration of the simulated data show
that the velocity only displays fluctuations of strength FORMULA  around
its mean speed FORMULA , therefore
anticipation alone is not able to generate a synchronized
state. Moreover, the strong anticorrelation found in the SKA is not present in measured data, cf. figure REF .

Conlusions
The effects of anticipatory driving are investigated by means of
simulation as well as analytical calculations. As a reference for
comparison a well–understood traffic flow model
{{cite:6b4d7cad-5350-4d53-82d3-ff7ab53ae610}}, {{cite:d63f9077-20d6-4544-8e90-8f3e2cf437d4}}, {{cite:491cfec9-c44e-45d6-9352-8d6925ea76c9}} was enhanced by next–nearest–neighbour
interaction and investigated under certain aspects. Simulation results
show that the introduction of anticipation does not lead to changes in
the mechanism that generates wide moving jams nor does the
dynamics inside a jam changes. However, one observes a stabilization
of the flow in dense traffic, which is "crucial to overcome the
difficulties in describing the empirically observed phases and their
transitions" {{cite:761a9475-36a1-40dc-9f7d-5f01d650ad88}}. Moreover, as one could have been
expecting, the “optimized” driving strategy leads to very short
temporal headways under free flow conditions. Such short headways are
also found in measurements on streets. Their existence can be
explained quite general by exploring the mechanism that is introduced
in the model by next–nearest–neighbour interaction.
In the present article it is shown
that this general mechanism works by
coupling three cars
together to share their two respective headways: if one car is fairly
close to the car in front, then its follower has to hold a distance
that is roughly equal to the average speed of the car-ensemble.
Obviously, this can be generalized to many cars in front, leading in
principle to a situation that has been envisioned already by the
automobile industry: platoons of cars that are electronically coupled
to optimize the energy consumption by driving with very small headways
at very large speeds. There, this goal is achieved by very small
reaction times of the control system, while an approach based on the
ansatz chosen for car-following with anticipation just needs
communication to more than one car ahead, but more human-like reaction
times.
Surprisingly, despite the fact that the approach of sharing headways
sounds fairly natural, it is not easy to show that it happens in
reality also. Single-car data (figure REF ) show no sign of
anticorrelation in car headways, whereas all models working with
anticipation display clearly. Beside the SKA we investigated the
BL–CA {{cite:8c0677bc-416c-46a8-9190-85b48ebab55b}} as a representative for a cellular–automaton
approach in the same way in order to confirm that assertion.
Therefore, anticipation alone is not able to explain all traffic
states and their microscopic behaviour found in observations.
The authors like to thank Andreas Schadschneider for useful
discussions.
