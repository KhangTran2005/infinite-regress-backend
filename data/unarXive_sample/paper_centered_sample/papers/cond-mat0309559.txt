The denaturation of double-stranded DNA as function of
force and temperature is discussed. At room temperature,
sequence heterogeneity dominates the physics of
single molecule force-extension curves starting
about 7 piconewtons of below a FORMULA 15 FORMULA  unzipping
transition. The dynamics of the unzipping fork exhibits
anomalous drift and diffusion in a similar range above this
transition. Energy barriers
near the transition scale as the square root
of the genome size. Recent observations of
jumps and plateaus in the unzipping of lambda phage DNA at
constant force are
consistent with these predictions.

Single Molecule Biophysics Experiments
The past decade has seen a revolution in biophysics,
due to
exquisitely sensitive experiments {{cite:60cc6b92-6e02-48e2-a02e-25b1ac993b66}}
which probe ingredients of the “central dogma”
of molecular biology {{cite:f7db5410-6033-4976-a76b-0ed864d019fa}} at the level of
individual molecules. Although exceptions exist,
the central dogma states that biological
information first flows from
DNA to messenger RNA via transcription mediated by a
RNA polymerase. Information is then transferred from mRNA
to proteins via a ribosome-mediated translation process.
Among the efforts to probe the basic constituents further:
(a) Proteins anchored to a microscope slide in their
biologically relevant folded state have been teased apart
with atomic force probes {{cite:7f3f36e9-77c4-4847-90ce-1c785cbe8dff}} attached using, e.g.,
biotin-streptavidin linkages;
(b) individual DNA's linked to magnetic beads have been
stretched and twisted by small magnetic field
gradients, allowing studies of both supercoiling
and twist-induced denaturation {{cite:e9252afd-4576-4857-95a3-0c544b772839}}; and
(c) the reversible unfolding of single RNA molecules (with
beads attached to both ends) has been studied using laser
tweezers with a feedback loop to generate a constant force
FORMULA  {{cite:939725b5-704d-4080-9368-5b81a00ef373}}. In this later experiment, the fluctuating
displacements of a FORMULA 25 base-pair RNA hairpin evolve from a
predominantly closed state (with rare opening events)
at small force to a predominantly open state (with rare closing events)
at larger forces. At an intermediate
force of FORMULA  piconewtons
FORMULA , the hairpin spends approximately equal time in both
configurations, suggestive of a first-order phase
transition between the open and closed states in the
“thermodynamic limit” of a very large hairpin.
FIGURE 
DNA force denaturation experiments related to the
subject of this review have been carried by
Bockelmann et al. {{cite:50c0b4ed-4e3e-49c3-988a-cb8e812543a5}}, {{cite:56e3ea62-92e3-45ae-8455-bbe8051d5e3d}}, {{cite:722ae369-06aa-4aa4-9497-a1de822f194e}}
(see Fig. 1). In this pioneering work, the
48,502 base pairs of the virus phage lambda with
one strand attached to a microscope slide were
unzipped by a microneedle attached to the other
strand under conditions which produced a constant
rate of unzipping at a fixed temperature. Reasonable
agreement with these experiments was obtained by direct
numerical evaluation of the equilibrium statistical
sums associated with a given average degree of
unzipping. If the rate of unzipping is slow, such
experiments effectively probe the physics at constant
extension. The average force under these conditions
locks in at about 14–15 piconewtons. The
time-dependent fluctuations of this force as the
unzipping proceeds provide information about the
particular sequence of G:C and A:T base
pairs being torn apart {{cite:50c0b4ed-4e3e-49c3-988a-cb8e812543a5}}, {{cite:56e3ea62-92e3-45ae-8455-bbe8051d5e3d}}, {{cite:722ae369-06aa-4aa4-9497-a1de822f194e}}.
The full phase diagram of DNA in the
force-temperature plane is shown in Fig. 2 {{cite:7235c486-adb2-4eff-bb31-4123199e8ecf}}, {{cite:490dc4fe-1705-4f5e-b8e9-2fce7e703878}}, {{cite:d04cd403-8c71-4eaf-8824-9ed0cabe1ed0}}, {{cite:a7785571-cf1d-437b-afa1-13f0c698415f}}, {{cite:8e97390d-2a2c-4732-9cb4-cec220ad6273}}.
The thermal DNA melting transition at zero force
(see Sec. 2) is characterized by diverging
length scales associated with denaturation
bubbles. When FORMULA , the native duplex
DNA denatures into an unzipped state via a
first-order phase transition (see Sec. 3).
Under conditions of a slow, constant rate of
extension {{cite:50c0b4ed-4e3e-49c3-988a-cb8e812543a5}}, {{cite:56e3ea62-92e3-45ae-8455-bbe8051d5e3d}}, {{cite:722ae369-06aa-4aa4-9497-a1de822f194e}}, the average force
adjusts so that the system sits on the
heavy first-order transition line FORMULA . At
any stage in the unzipping process, the unzipping
fork separating the native and unzipped states
is like the meniscus dividing, say, liquid and
gas phases at constant volume at a bulk
first-order phase transition.
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
Although running unzipping experiments in a
two-phase region associated with the line FORMULA  is
well-suited for possible DNA sequencing
applications {{cite:50c0b4ed-4e3e-49c3-988a-cb8e812543a5}}, {{cite:56e3ea62-92e3-45ae-8455-bbe8051d5e3d}}, {{cite:722ae369-06aa-4aa4-9497-a1de822f194e}}, the full force-temperature
phase diagram of Fig. 2 is interesting for a number
of reasons. First, understanding DNA denaturation
under conditions of constant force
(instead of constant extension) could
provide insights into the complicated process
by which DNA replicates during bacterial cell division
{{cite:717340df-989c-4079-89b2-a683bea86ad1}}. Second, statistical mechanics in
ensembles with intensive variables like the
force held fixed is often more tractable than when
the control parameter is a conjugate variable like
the extension. Precise analytic predications are
indeed possible in the vicinity of FORMULA , even when
sequence disorder is present {{cite:7235c486-adb2-4eff-bb31-4123199e8ecf}}, {{cite:1129b6f2-5993-4266-898f-f56f31d7f1b2}}. Third,
experiments which use force
as a control parameter can probe interesting
behavior of the unzipping fork for FORMULA 
(analogous to “wetting” phenomena in bulk phase
transitions {{cite:2218d81d-92fa-4a34-8058-305c3aa5c507}}) and anomalous fork
dynamics for FORMULA . Because of significantly
different bonding strengths of the nucleotide
pairs A:T (two hydrogen bonds) and G:C
(three hydrogen bonds), heterogeneity dominates
unzipping over a large region of the phase diagram,
for FORMULA ,
inside the region bounded by the dashed lines in Fig. 2.

Thermal Denaturation of DNA
In this Section we discuss the thermal denaturation
of DNA at zero force (vertical arrow in Fig. 2).
This transition plays an important role in the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), where it is applied
cyclically to amplify minute amounts of DNA.
The basic physical ideas driving thermal denaturation
(worked out in the 1960s)
are described in Refs. {{cite:1323c664-c653-400c-b2ff-ea77045855c4}}, {{cite:86629b49-4172-4778-ba66-57f70eedadde}}, {{cite:2d3993c9-8ffc-44ec-8cb4-cf699cde1a87}}. The simplest
models invoke the Ising-like description of DNA shown
in Fig. 3a, where right-facing spins represent
bonded nucleotides in a closed
“helix” state and left-facing spins the open
“coil” state. The magnetic field
of the equivalent Ising model represents a
(temperature-dependent)
nucleotide bonding free energy and the Ising
exchange energy determines an “initiation factor”
at the boundaries between the
helix and coil regions. The statistical
mechanics of this one-dimensional Ising model
can be described entirely in terms of
kink excitations associated with transitions
between domains of up and down spins,
which here represent helix/coil boundaries.
Rapid variations in DNA from a helix-dominated
to a coil-dominated state are predicted
by such models {{cite:2d3993c9-8ffc-44ec-8cb4-cf699cde1a87}}, corresponding to the
magnetic field changing sign in the
equivalent Ising system. However,
it is well-known that the 1d Ising model
does not have a real
phase transition at finite temperature,
basically because the finite energy
cost of kinks at zero external
field is overwhelmed by the
entropy gained by creating them
[20]. An improved theory
results when the three-dimensional
entropy of wandering loops
in the coil sections (see Fig. 3b)
is taken into account. This can
be done by approximating the loops
as ideal random walks {{cite:1323c664-c653-400c-b2ff-ea77045855c4}},
or improving this estimate by taking
self-avoidance of the loops
into account {{cite:b89631a2-1572-4d5a-94b9-dbb36781e15e}}. The effect on the
statistical mechanics is
to produce a long range interaction
which binds kinks together and
leads to a continuous finite temperature
phase transition {{cite:1323c664-c653-400c-b2ff-ea77045855c4}}, {{cite:86629b49-4172-4778-ba66-57f70eedadde}}, {{cite:2d3993c9-8ffc-44ec-8cb4-cf699cde1a87}}.
Recent work by Kafri et al. incorporates
additional self-avoidance
between coil sections and the rest of the
DNA chain (important for
large molecules) and argues that
the thermal denaturation transition then becomes first order
{{cite:b82c2ba5-add6-4e07-aa1c-6da330ef4e8d}}.
Heterogeneity of the bonding between
base pairs (G:C bonds are stronger than
A:T ones) is neglected in the treatments above.
Simple helix-coil descriptions with
heterogeneity are governed by the statistical
mechanics of the 1d random field
Ising model. A reasonable guess for
more realistic models with heterogeneity is
that while the transition may be less sharp
(weakly bound regions melt before more tightly
bound ones), a real finite temperature phase
transition survives. Lyubchenko et al. {{cite:b7e8db44-4093-411b-b72c-a6de2c389ccb}}
have calculated numerically the effect of
sequence heterogeneity on the DNA differential
melting curves for the 5375 nucleotides
of the virus FORMULA . For a recent theory of
thermal denaturation of heterogeneous DNA,
see Ref. {{cite:29e4e1a8-97d1-4c70-8507-3d51f09c4a3e}}.
In the remainder of this section, we discuss
how thermal denaturation of “homogeneous”
DNA with identical base pairs
can also be understood
by mapping the statistical mechanics
onto the delocalization of a quantum
mechanical particle in three dimensions.
This is the approach we will
generalize in Sec. 3 to study
force-induced naturation.
Referring to Fig. 3b, we parameterize the
positions of the two (antiparallel)
sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA in three dimensions
by the functions FORMULA  and
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is an integer
indexing FORMULA  base pairs FORMULA . We
model each strand separately as a Gaussian random
coil {{cite:7fe0f6ef-100a-49fe-896e-81338d0e1cb8}} . For example, considering strand 1
in isolation, the probability of a particular
polymer conformation FORMULA 
is proportional to FORMULA 
(we use units such that FORMULA ), where
FORMULA 
Here we have used a convenient continuum notation
as shorthand for a discrete sum over
FORMULA  and replaced FORMULA  by the
arclength FORMULA , where FORMULA  is
the spacing between nucleotide monomers.
To relate the spring constant
FORMULA  to the single strand persistence
length, use (1) to evaluate
FORMULA , with the result
FORMULA 
From the definition of persistance length FORMULA , namely
FORMULA , we have {{cite:a73eac62-a7d4-44e3-b289-89592c8fe795}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA Å for single-stranded DNA at
physiological temperatures. For a more microscopic
“worm-like chain” model with bending rigidity FORMULA  (assuming
a small Debye screening length), we
have {{cite:fbbcb5b3-18be-47db-bbb1-33eb229c6f56}}, {{cite:982b9478-af87-42c6-ac20-9eefc96da96e}}
FORMULA 
Here, and in what follows, we use boldface vectors
FORMULA  to denote entire polymer configurations, and conventional vectors such
as FORMULA  to denote the position of a polymer endpoint.
To describe a DNA duplex, we bring the two strands together,
neglect torsional rigidity and the helical nature of the bonding
{{cite:982b9478-af87-42c6-ac20-9eefc96da96e}},
and write the total free energy as
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA  is a potential which binds the nucleotides in different strands
together. We assume that the complimentarity of the nucleotide sequences is
sufficient to bring the strands into registry, but will otherwise neglect
the effect of sequence disorder in the remainder of this section. If we now
pass to sum and difference variables.
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
the coarse-grained free energy decouples,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
The partition function associated with (8) is a path integral
of FORMULA  over the functions FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The part associated with FORMULA  is simply the partition sum of
an unconstrained Gaussian coil. The remaining functional integral
over FORMULA  contains a denaturation transition. To pursue this
point, we assume for simplicity that FORMULA  and
FORMULA  (closed boundary conditions at one end,
open at the other), and evaluate
FORMULA 
As in polymer adsorption problems, it is helpful to view Eq. (9) as a
Feynman path integral for a quantum mechanical particle in imaginary
time
{{cite:fbbcb5b3-18be-47db-bbb1-33eb229c6f56}}.
Indeed, this partition function can be rewritten as a
quantum mechanical matrix element {{cite:edc29dfb-fba8-44b9-890c-6edae5f47d1c}},
FORMULA 
where the effective quantum Hamiltonian is
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  and FORMULA  are respectively FORMULA  and FORMULA 
vectors localized at FORMULA  and FORMULA . Note that
temperature plays the role of FORMULA  and FORMULA 
represents the mass of a fictitious quantum mechanical particle in a
potential FORMULA . In the language of statistical mechanics,
we have reduced this one-dimensional problem to diagonalizing a
transfer matrix given by FORMULA . We shall focus
on the particularly simple binding potential illustrated in Fig. 4, namely
FORMULA 
with FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the average bonding energy per nucleotide. Upon
inserting a complete set of energy eigenfunctions FORMULA  with eigenvalues FORMULA  into Eq. (10), we see that
this conditional partition function may be rewritten as
FORMULA 
FIGURE 
The ground state dominates in the limit FORMULA , and we have
FORMULA 
where the (nodeless) ground state eigenfunction can be chosen to be real.
The quantum mechanics of simple square well potentials like
Eq. (12) in three dimensions is well understood {{cite:73e6ba17-ed2f-414e-a385-6b43c38ff398}}.
We focus for simplicity on the case FORMULA 
(small hard core diameter) but the same qualitative
discussion applies more generally. The
key parameter controlling the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues is the
dimensionless ratio
FORMULA 
of the well depth FORMULA  to the “zero point energy” FORMULA . This quantum zero point energy represents the lost
entropy associated with a confined DNA duplex. From the
perspective of quantum mechanics, the loop excitations shown in Fig. 3b represent
transient excursions (in imaginary time) out of the well.
When FORMULA  (low temperatures), the binding energy dominates the thermal
fluctuations favoring denaturation and there are many bound (i.e., localized)
eigenstates of  FORMULA beneath a continuum of extended eigenstates.
As FORMULA  decreases, more and more states delocalize until only the single
localized ground state shown in Fig. (4a) is present. Eventually,
at temperatures high enough so that FORMULA , even the ground state
delocalizes [31]. For the simple problem discussed here FORMULA 
(i.e., FORMULA ) [30]. However, a similar
FORMULA  of order unity is expected for a broad class of similar
potentials. Near the transition temperature FORMULA , the ground
state energy approaches the continuum quadratically with temperature [27, 30]
FORMULA 
where the melting temperature FORMULA  is defined by FORMULA . For large FORMULA , the ground state wave
function decays exponentially, FORMULA ,
where
FORMULA 
gives the spatial extent (in three dimensions) of the bubbles shown
schematically in Fig. 3b. The number of base pairs FORMULA 
in a bubble (see Fig. 3b) can be estimated by identifying FORMULA 
with the value of FORMULA  needed to achieve ground
state dominance in Eq. (12): We expect that boundary effects
become unimportant when the number of base pairs exceeds
the number in a typical bubble. The ground state will dominate once the
number of nucleotides is larger than several bubble sizes. Since the
energy of the first excited state for FORMULA  is zero, we have
FORMULA 
from which it follows that
FORMULA 
We should stress that the above results are obtained in an approximation which
neglects self-avoidance effects important for large molecules close to FORMULA .
We expect, however, qualitatively similar behavior even when self-avoidance is taken
into account.
We now use similar methods to treat force-induced denaturation in Section 3.

Force-induced Denaturation
A force FORMULA  applied across the two strand endpoints
(see Fig. 1) adds an energy FORMULA , and Eq. (9) becomes
FORMULA 
We assume the attached strands of DNA can swivel freely
to relax twist on an experimental time scale, so that we
can neglect the helical nature of the duplex state when the
force is applied.
In addition to the force term (note that the lower limit does
not contribute with our boundary conditions), we have added a subscript FORMULA  to the binding
potential, FORMULA ,
to emphasize that the depth and size of potentials like that in Fig. 4
will depend on the particular base pair for heterogeneous DNA. After
taking over results for a virtually identical problem {{cite:2e1a1e02-45d3-47b8-bdc0-f492f17b3877}} of flux line
depinning by a columnar pin in a transverse magnetic field in high
FORMULA  superconductors, we obtain {{cite:7235c486-adb2-4eff-bb31-4123199e8ecf}}, {{cite:490dc4fe-1705-4f5e-b8e9-2fce7e703878}}
FORMULA 
which can be integrated (subject to the boundary condition
FORMULA ) to give a result with the form of Eq. (10),
where
FORMULA 
Equation (20) with an FORMULA -dependent potential FORMULA  can
be studied (via a mapping onto a Burgers equation) by the methods of
Ref. {{cite:649fd661-e25e-47d4-afb5-059ce6feebb3}}, where it arose in a study of vortex
depinning from fragmented columnar pins. In this
section, we neglect the FORMULA -dependence (letting FORMULA ) and illustrate
force-induced denaturation for the homopolymer duplex discussed in
Sec. 2.
Because FORMULA  appears as a constant imaginary “vector potential,” Eq. (21)
represents a non-Hermitian generalization of Schroedinger's equation.
To establish the existence of a first-order transition, we
write the solutions of (20) using the right and left
eigenfunctions FORMULA  and
FORMULA  (with
a set of common eigenvalues FORMULA ) of FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
We again
invoke ground-state dominance and focus on the behavior of the lowest eigenvalue,
which determines the duplex free energy per unit length FORMULA  via
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is defined by integrating over FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
since we work at constant force instead of constant extension.
For FORMULA  less than a critical value FORMULA  (determined below), we can obtain
the (right) eigenfunctions FORMULA  for FORMULA 
from localized eigenfunctions FORMULA  for the Hermitian case
FORMULA  via a “gauge transformation” {{cite:2e1a1e02-45d3-47b8-bdc0-f492f17b3877}}.
Indeed, it is easy to check that
FORMULA 
solves
FORMULA 
(provided FORMULA  satisfies FORMULA ) with the
same eigenvalue, FORMULA . In
particular, we obtain from Eq. (23) a negative FORMULA -independent
free energy per unit length FORMULA  for small FORMULA .
If, however, a localized ground-state eigenfunction
for the Hermitian FORMULA  problem decays like
FORMULA 
for large FORMULA , the new eigenfunctions (25) are only
normalizable provided FORMULA .
Note that FORMULA , which gives
the probability of finding an extension FORMULA , {{cite:2e1a1e02-45d3-47b8-bdc0-f492f17b3877}} is displaced in the direction
of FORMULA , as indicated schematically in
Fig. 4a. To determine what happens for
FORMULA , we check for a nodeless extended
ground-state wavefunction, as indicated in Fig. 4b.
If FORMULA  for large FORMULA 
(i.e., the DNA duplex falls apart), and FORMULA , evaluating Eq. (22) in this limit gives
FORMULA , so that
FORMULA . The two free energies
FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA  are plotted in
Fig. 5 {{cite:2e1a1e02-45d3-47b8-bdc0-f492f17b3877}}. At FORMULA  the two curves intersect at a nonzero
angle, the classic signature of a first-order phase transition. The latent
heat of this transition might be observable in a solution of many
DNA duplexes pulled apart by, say, beads of opposite charge in an
electric field.
Since the first-order transition curve FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the smallest
eigenvalue of the transfer matrix for FORMULA , we find using
Eq. (15) that
FORMULA 
near the melting transition for this model.
FIGURE 
Even though force-induced denaturation is a first-order
transition, there are diverging precursors in the form of DNA
unzipping (see Fig. 1). The probability of an endpoint
separation FORMULA  in the limit FORMULA  is
given integrating FORMULA  weighted by
the ground state eigenfunction,
FORMULA 
It is then straightforward to show that FORMULA 
diverges as FORMULA  {{cite:2e1a1e02-45d3-47b8-bdc0-f492f17b3877}}
FORMULA 
Upon examining corrections to
ground state dominance as in the analysis of
Eq. (19), we find that the average number FORMULA  of
unzipped monomers diverges, as shown in Fig. 6a,
FORMULA 
FIGURE 
The first-order force-induced DNA denaturation transition can be understood
more generally, independent of the mapping onto quantum
mechanics. If FORMULA  is the free energy per unit length
of one of the single-stranded DNA “handles” shown in Fig. 7,
and FORMULA  is the (force-independent) free energy per
unit length of the double-stranded DNA which coexists
in a macroscopically unzipped state, then the condition for
two-phase coexistence across the “meniscus” or
unzipping fork at the critical force FORMULA  is {{cite:1129b6f2-5993-4266-898f-f56f31d7f1b2}}
FORMULA 
The physics of the handle free energy FORMULA  is relatively simple,
provided the force is large enough to neglect self-hybridization and self-avoidance of the
single-stranded DNA. For example, we could take FORMULA  to be the free energy of
a freely-jointed chain with persistance length FORMULA  {{cite:7fe0f6ef-100a-49fe-896e-81338d0e1cb8}}
FORMULA 
which is proportional to FORMULA  for small FORMULA . Alternatively one could use a more sophisticated
“worm-line chain” approximation valid over a larger range
of forces {{cite:bda40810-dc04-4921-9489-d7ff9f849a97}}. With an acceptable approximation to FORMULA 
in hand (if necessary, this function could be obtained directly from
integrating single strand force-extension curves {{cite:698f36ed-67c5-4ce6-b199-2dca1add6e08}}), one can
use the experimentally determined phase boundary FORMULA  for
unzipping in conjunction with Eq. (31) to explore the temperature
dependence of the free energy FORMULA  of double-stranded DNA.
FIGURE 

Unzipping with Sequence Heterogeneity
The effect of sequence heterogeneity on thermal denaturation of DNA
at zero force is a subtle and still not completely resolved
problem, {{cite:2d3993c9-8ffc-44ec-8cb4-cf699cde1a87}}, {{cite:b7e8db44-4093-411b-b72c-a6de2c389ccb}}, {{cite:29e4e1a8-97d1-4c70-8507-3d51f09c4a3e}}. Understanding inhomogeneous base pairing
energies near the first-order force-induced unzipping transition
appears to be more tractable. The integrated effect of
sequence randomness on the energy landscape for long strands
of DNA does not change the underlying first-order transition, because it
only produces corrections of order FORMULA 
to the free energies per unit length discussed above, where
FORMULA  is the total number of base pairs. However, sequence randomness
has drastic consequences for quantities like FORMULA 
which characterize the unzipping process itself {{cite:7235c486-adb2-4eff-bb31-4123199e8ecf}}, {{cite:1129b6f2-5993-4266-898f-f56f31d7f1b2}}. Here, we simply
sketch the overall picture. Detailed calculations and justifications for
approximations (such as the neglect of bubbles in DNA) can be
found in Ref. {{cite:1129b6f2-5993-4266-898f-f56f31d7f1b2}}.
Consider the energy FORMULA  associated with the conditional
partition sum of a DNA duplex which has been unzipped by FORMULA  base pairs.
If the DNA is a homopolymer, consisting exclusively of A:T or G:C base
pairs, the total energy can be read off from Fig. 7,
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
can be expanded to give FORMULA 
near the unzipping transition. If we now add sequence randomness, a reasonable
model for the energy of unzipping is
FORMULA 
where deviations from the average A:T or G:C content are
represented by the function FORMULA  in a convenient
continuum notation. To the extent that most DNA
sequences which code for proteins have deviations from the
average G:C/A:T content describable as a random walk {{cite:8967ec53-fa7e-42d7-b89a-1a149f111a42}}, we expect
that the statistical properties of FORMULA  at large distances are those of a
white-noise random variable,
FORMULA 
where the overbar represents a “disorder average” over all possible
sequences of base pairs. Because G:C and A:T pairing energies
differ by an amount of order FORMULA , FORMULA , where
we have used the temperature FORMULA  293–310FORMULA K characteristic of most experiments to
characterize this quantity. The partition function
associated with this simple one-dimensional model involves
integrating over all possible unzipping lengths FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
The unzipping energy in Eq. (35) is plotted for a particular
base pair sequence (with FORMULA ) in Fig. 8, with FORMULA . The
straight line is the energy of a homopolymer duplex with
FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
In this case we find immediately from
Eq. (37) that the thermally averaged degree of unzipping is
FORMULA 
in agreement with Eq. (30). There are large fluctuations about this average
value, as one can check by evaluating
FORMULA 
FIGURE 
The rugged landscape in Fig. 8 for FORMULA  is more
interesting. Although the positive background slope determined by FORMULA 
insures that the DNA remains macroscopically unzipped, the integrated
effect of sequence randomness produces deviations from a straight line
which scale like FORMULA . These fluctuations lead to deep minima at
nonzero FORMULA  with large energy barriers in between.
A downward fluctuation in this
“integrated random walk” energy landscape at position FORMULA  corresponds
to an energy of order
FORMULA 
Upon minimizing over FORMULA , we obtain the estimate

represents an average over a quenched random distribution of DNA sequences.
It can also be shown that thermal fluctuations about this average are more
constrained than for homopolymers, in the sense that

Thus, in contrast to homopolymers, where
FORMULA  we now have
FORMULA 
A typical energy barrier associated with disorder-dominated
unzipping is FORMULA . Results such as (42) apply when this scale
exceeds FORMULA , i.e., for FORMULA  less than a crossover force FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Because FORMULA  is large for G:C and A:T base
pairs, the range of forces where sequence heterogeneity dominates the
physics is the large region bounded by the left-hand dashed line in
Fig. 2. Note that disordered dominated prediction for FORMULA  in Eq. (42) diverges with a power which is twice
as large as the result (39) appropriate for thermally equilibrated
homopolymers.
Results such as Eq. (42) apply only to a quenched average over an
entire library of different DNA sequences unzipped in parallel. We can
understand the behavior for FORMULA  for
the more
experimentally accessible case of a particular
squence from Fig. 9, which shows the energy landscape for two
identical sequences with the biases, FORMULA  and
FORMULA . The degree of unzipping FORMULA  is
dominated by the minimum indicated by an arrow in each case. Somewhere
between FORMULA  and FORMULA , the average of FORMULA  jumps
from one minimum to the next. More detailed calculations [14] reveal
an entire sequence of jumps and plateaus, as illustrated in Fig. 6b.
Although a best fit to a power law of this irregular curve should
reveal the exponent of Eq. (42), the plateaus and jumps themselves
represent a rough “fingerprint” of the individual sequence.
See Ref. {{cite:1129b6f2-5993-4266-898f-f56f31d7f1b2}}, where the
statistical distribution of plateaus and jumps are
evaluated using the techniques of LeDoussal et al. {{cite:b37ddd59-6178-4535-80fe-6ae0ca6f6acf}}.

Dynamics of Unzipping
What happens for FORMULA ? In Figure 10 we show an energy
landscape (for the same sequence as in Fig. 8) with
FORMULA , together with the purely downhill landscape of the
corresponding homopolymer. Because the average free energy per base pair
of the DNA duplex exceeds the combined free energies per
base of the two single-stranded DNA “handles” in Fig. 7, the
system is unstable to complete unzipping. It is then appropriate to
discuss the dynamical process by which unzipping proceeds on this
downhill path.

Subject to a number of simplifying conditions discussed in Ref. {{cite:1129b6f2-5993-4266-898f-f56f31d7f1b2}},
the time dependence of the unzipping fork can be described by an
overdamped Langevin equation,

Upon substituting for the energy landscape FORMULA  from Eq. (35), we consider
the case FORMULA  and obtain
FORMULA 
which is the equation of motion for a particle with coordinate FORMULA 
executing one-dimensional biased diffusion in a random force field
proportional to FORMULA .
A great deal is known about this problem {{cite:f8bb5dd0-a770-4749-a55d-6ce91a851ba1}}, {{cite:bce51778-f939-4ce0-a5ab-6873efc67f91}}, {{cite:6f96dae2-521f-494d-9553-024522173812}}. In the absence of
sequence heterogeneity (FORMULA  in Eq. (36)), FORMULA  exhibits diffusion
with drift at long times, i.e.,
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
with a well-defined drift velocity FORMULA  and diffusion constant FORMULA . This
is the expected behavior for the straight line homopolymer energy landscape shown in Fig. 10.
Sequence heterogeneity, however, has a dramatic effect on the dynamics unless FORMULA 
is large. Indeed, the integrated random walk landscape in Fig. 10 has many deep
minima, even though the average slope is negative. When FORMULA  is small, typical
energy barriers to travel a distance FORMULA  scale like FORMULA , as is
reflected in the small barrier connecting the minima labelled A and B
and the much larger barrier between these minima and the more distant minimum C.
A detailed analysis {{cite:f8bb5dd0-a770-4749-a55d-6ce91a851ba1}}, {{cite:bce51778-f939-4ce0-a5ab-6873efc67f91}}, {{cite:6f96dae2-521f-494d-9553-024522173812}} reveals three types of anomalous dynamics,
depending on the dimensionless parameter

Right at the unzipping transition, FORMULA  and

because of trapping effects arising from the large energy barriers.
The conventional diffusion constant FORMULA , as defined by Eq. (50), vanishes. When
FORMULA , the unzipping fork drifts downhill, but does so sublinearly with time,

so the usual drift velocity FORMULA  defined by (49) vanishes, with an
additional anomaly in the spread about this average drift {{cite:bce51778-f939-4ce0-a5ab-6873efc67f91}}, {{cite:6f96dae2-521f-494d-9553-024522173812}}. When this
bias is large enough so that FORMULA , one recovers a
well-defined drift velocity FORMULA , but with
superdiffusive spreading,

Conventional diffusion with drift is only recovered for forces large enough so that FORMULA ,

This critical force is the same order of magnitude as the crossover scale defined below the
unzipping transition by Eq. (45) and leads to the right-hand dashed line in Fig. 2.
The parameters of DNA are such that anomalous unzipping appears in a very large range
(compared to typical disorder effects in conventional critical phenoman {{cite:8d4ef01e-d7ca-48a9-8e20-738f41739d5d}}),

Pauses, Jumps and Concluding Remarks
Experiments which study the mechanical denaturation
of lambda phage DNA at constant force have recently been carried out in the
group of Mara Prentiss [42]. Digoxigenin linkers attach several dozen identical
copies of this DNA along a long thin capillary tube. Each DNA
to be unzipped is offset by an additional
DNA spacer (see Fig. 11). Biotin links the other end of the DNA to magnetic
beads. Unzipping at constant force
is achieved by applying a uniform magnetic field gradient, causing
the beads to stretch out at right angles to the capillary tube, like a
series of flags on a flagpole.
Figure 12a records some unzipping histories at FORMULA C for three
different beads at different heights on this “flagpole” with
FORMULA  FORMULA , corresponding approximately to the critical unzipping force
for the front half of the sequence for phage lambda.
(The back half of this DNA has a lower G:C content.) The beads are well separated, and are
clearly subject to microscopically different thermal histories. Nevertheless,
there are distinctive pauses (some lasting 15 minutes or more) and jumps
common to the different beads. As the individual DNA's unzip, the beads
occasionally jump back and forth, suggesting two nearly degenerate minima in the
energy landscape about 1000 base pairs apart. This behavior is similar
to that found for much shorter RNA hairpains in Ref. {{cite:939725b5-704d-4080-9368-5b81a00ef373}}. The long pauses
before unzipping resumes are consistent with large energy barriers, of
order 20–30 FORMULA . In contrast, unzipping at a slow constant
velocity is an imperative in the work of Bockelmann et al. {{cite:50c0b4ed-4e3e-49c3-988a-cb8e812543a5}}, {{cite:56e3ea62-92e3-45ae-8455-bbe8051d5e3d}}, {{cite:722ae369-06aa-4aa4-9497-a1de822f194e}}.
Because these experiments are effectively at constant extension, the force in
this case fluctuates as needed about FORMULA  to insure that all
energy barriers are overcome.
Many of the pauses and local “two-level system” oscillations found by
the Prentiss group coincide with those predicted for phage lambda DNA {{cite:dbb2a877-5234-4856-9414-a04703e53438}},
using energy landscapes obtained from the base pairing and stacking
energies of Santa Lucia et al. {{cite:f1223680-497a-44cc-89c1-4f6eddb3e12c}}. Overall, these experiments seem
consistent with important aspects of the theory reviewed here, such
as large energy barriers and sequence-specific pause points.
We should stress that longer run times or higher temperatures are
necessary to obtain true thermodynamic equilibrium. Figure 12b shows
the unzipping history of four different beads at FORMULA  FORMULA . There
are again jumps between common plateaus as well as oscillations
suggesting nearly degenerate minima. Although 20 FORMULA  should be above the
thermodynamic critical force FORMULA , the DNA nevertheless fails to
unzip completely on experimental time scales, presumably due to the ruggedness of “downhill”
landscapes such as that in Fig. 10. Predictions such as Eq. (42) are
only be applicable to systems in true thermodynamic equilibrium.
Experimental checks of phase diagrams such as that in Fig. 2 and the
associated physical predictions would be of considerable interest. As
mentioned in Sec. 3, the phase diagram itself can be used to directly
measure the temperature-dependent free energy of the DNA duplex at zero
force. Analysis of this free energy is simplified if a theory of
the unzipped handles is available. Analytic theories require forces large enough to
stretch out the handles and prevent hairpins created by self-hybridization.
The self-hybridization of ssDNA (for FORMULA  FORMULA ) indicated in the
experiments of Maier et al. {{cite:94bf5ecb-1c9c-429b-b2ef-edbf6fc744f3}} could be reduced by
introducing single stranded binding proteins to smooth out the heterogeneity of the
handles.
The assumption (36) of short-range correlations in the sequence is an
approximation valid only for simple “coding DNA” in bacteria or viruses.
The introns or so-called
“junk DNA” present in many eukaryotic organisms may be better
described by {{cite:8967ec53-fa7e-42d7-b89a-1a149f111a42}}
FORMULA 
with FORMULA . Although we are unaware of detailed
calculations, a straightforward generalization of the argument
leading to Eq. (42) now gives {{cite:7235c486-adb2-4eff-bb31-4123199e8ecf}}
FORMULA 
For FORMULA , we expect that predictions for
sequences with short-range correlations will apply. The
exponent FORMULA  seems to describe the energy
correlations of some intron-rich sequences [36].
Ideas similar to those discussed here
can also be applied to force-induced denaturation {{cite:c2d5e92a-9d84-481a-be44-451b094856bc}}, {{cite:1129b6f2-5993-4266-898f-f56f31d7f1b2}} of the
multiple stem-loop structures which define the secondary structure of
complicated RNA enzymes. Here, however, strings of RNA hairpins are
unzipped simultaneously and the discrete jumps and
plateaus in FORMULA  near the unzipping force are averaged out.

Virtually all the theoretical work described here is contained in
the Ph.D. thesis of my former student, David Lubensky. I am
fortunate to have such students. I am grateful as well to
Claudia Danilowicz, Mara Prentiss and other experimenters for
their determination to test some of the predictions sketched
here. Finally, I would like to thank D. Branton, R. Bundschuh, T. Hwa,
