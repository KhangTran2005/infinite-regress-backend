Spacetimes have conventionally been described by a global Lorentzian
metric on a differentiable four-manifold. Herein we explore
the possibility of spacetimes defined by a connection, which is locally but
not globally Levi-Civita. The general method of obtaining such
connections is presented for the non-degenerate case followed by an
example that modifies the Robertson-Walker spacetimes for flat
spacelike hypersurfaces.

Introduction
Since its inception, general relativity has comprised two principal ingredients:
a four-dimensional manifold FORMULA  and a Lorentzian metric
defined on FORMULA . Other objects, such as gauge or matter fields may also be employed,
serving to influence the geometry of gravitation through the field equations
FORMULA 
The four-dimensional manifold hypothesis has been the more flexible of the
two key constituents of spacetime; Kaluza and Klein, for instance,
have contemplated spaces of higher dimension,
whose compactifications were thought to explain some of the features of the physical world
(cf. {{cite:e3025a9b-6bf7-4abf-a3d0-b38c474edf9e}}, {{cite:3e2fa04f-a7ee-4441-a0f6-243ee2471a9d}}).
On the other hand, the notion of a globally defined Lorentzian metric has remained,
by and large, unmodified.
The field equations (REF ) are covariant with respect to the diffeomorphism
group Diff, of FORMULA . Early on, diffeomorphism covariance posed difficulties
in the
interpretation of general relativity, leading to the "hole" argument and its
resolution by means of defining the gravitational state as a diffeomorphism class of
solutions to (REF ). For certain systems, such as the massless scalar field
or the vacuum, the energy-momentum tensor is invariant under the group Conf, of
constant conformal rescalings of the metric:
FORMULA , FORMULA  (cf. {{cite:d43ee660-ee55-43ef-85e1-c8c15adde703}}).
Equations (REF ) are then also invariant
under such transformations and so physical states would be defined as equivalence
classes with respect to the enlarged group Diff FORMULA  Conf (cf. {{cite:0f85d7ac-2473-4795-ae3c-dbce5b04ba6d}}).
These considerations suggest the possibility of spacetimes that are described by a
locally metric connection. A connection FORMULA  on FORMULA  is
locally metric if for each point FORMULA  there exists
an open neighbourhood FORMULA  of FORMULA  and a metric on FORMULA  that is parallel with
respect to FORMULA ; these locally defined parallel metrics might not piece together
into a global metric on FORMULA  (cf. {{cite:f227c61f-887a-4efe-9180-32ae05287ebc}}).
We shall be primarily concerned with such connections that are, moreover, non-degenerate
in the sense that for each open subset FORMULA  of FORMULA  the vector space of parallel metrics on
FORMULA  has dimension at most one; otherwise certain pathologies may arise
with regard to the causal structure of spacetime.
When the energy-momentum tensor is invariant under constant rescalings of the metric,
the field equations (REF ) retain meaning in this context.
In this case, the prospect arises that spacetime might be defined locally and not through
a global Lorentzian structure.
In the following section we develop a
characterization of non-degenerate, locally metric connections.
It is shown that such connections FORMULA  satisfy an equation
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is a metric on FORMULA  and FORMULA  is a closed 1-form.
Furthermore, FORMULA  is globally metric if and only if FORMULA  is exact.
The final section investigates two examples. The first applies the methods
of Section 2 for constructing non-globally metric spacetimes and the second examines
a degenerate locally metric solution.

Locally Metric Connections
In this section we seek to determine the general structure of symmetric, non-degenerate,
locally metric connections on a manifold FORMULA . They are
described most succinctly in terms of a pair FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a metric and
FORMULA  is a closed 1-form on FORMULA . From a practical perspective it is sometimes convenient to
construct such connections by geometric considerations on the universal cover of FORMULA .
We shall pursue both avenues below and the relation between them.
Let FORMULA  be a non-degenerate, locally metric Lorentzian connection on a manifold FORMULA  of
dimension greater than two. At this stage we do not assume that FORMULA  is symmetric.
By non-degeneracy, the set of local parallel metrics for FORMULA  generates a line bundle
FORMULA  over FORMULA .
We may obtain a global non-vanishing section FORMULA  of FORMULA  by means of a partition of unity
argument. Let FORMULA 
be an open cover of FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is a trivial line
bundle over FORMULA  for each FORMULA . Then on each FORMULA  there is a non-vanishing
section FORMULA  with signature FORMULA .
Consider any two such local sections FORMULA  and FORMULA  that are defined at some
common point FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  has rank one, FORMULA  and FORMULA  are non-zero
multiples of each other. Furthermore, since FORMULA  FORMULA  and
FORMULA  and FORMULA  have the same signature, they must be positive
multiples of each other.
Let
FORMULA  with FORMULA  be a partition of unity
subordinate to FORMULA : FORMULA  for each FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Consider the sum
FORMULA 
Given any FORMULA  there are only finitely many indices FORMULA 
for which FORMULA . As we have observed, the bilinear forms
FORMULA  are positive multiples of each other and
so
FORMULA 
is a non-degenerate bilinear form of signature FORMULA .
It follows that FORMULA  is a non-vanishing section of FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is locally metric
there exists, for each point FORMULA  in FORMULA , an open neighbourhood FORMULA  of FORMULA  and a parallel
local section FORMULA  of signature FORMULA .
In view of the fact that FORMULA  has rank one, FORMULA  and the restriction FORMULA 
are conformally equivalent:
FORMULA  for some function FORMULA .
Taking the covariant derivative of FORMULA  gives
FORMULA  on FORMULA .
Since FORMULA : FORMULA  is an open cover of FORMULA , FORMULA 
for some closed 1-form FORMULA  on FORMULA ; on FORMULA  FORMULA  restricts to FORMULA .
Even though we have focused on locally metric Lorentzian connections above it is clear that
the results apply to locally metric Riemannian connections as well. The theorem
summarizes the discussion so far.
Theorem 1                    
Let FORMULA  be a non-degenerate, locally metric connection, which is Lorentzian on a manifold
FORMULA  of dimension greater than two or Riemannian on a manifold of any dimension.
Then there exists a metric FORMULA  and a closed 1-form
FORMULA  on FORMULA  such that FORMULA  satisfies the equation
FORMULA 

A partial converse to the theorem is given by the following proposition.
Proposition 2 
Suppose FORMULA , where FORMULA 
is a metric and FORMULA  is a closed 1-form on FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is locally metric.
If FORMULA  on an open subset FORMULA  of FORMULA , for some
FORMULA , then FORMULA .

Proof:
Since FORMULA  is a closed 1-form, for each FORMULA  there exists an open neighbourhood
FORMULA  of FORMULA  such that FORMULA , for some FORMULA .
On FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
 FORMULA
Proposition 3 Suppose FORMULA , where FORMULA 
is a metric and FORMULA  is a closed 1-form on FORMULA .
(a) If FORMULA  is exact then FORMULA  is a (globally)
metric connection on FORMULA .
(b) If FORMULA  is a non-degenerate (globally) metric connection on FORMULA 
then FORMULA  is exact.

Proof:
FORMULA 
follows from Proposition REF  with FORMULA .
FORMULA 
Suppose that FORMULA  is a non-degenerate (globally) metric connection:
FORMULA  for some metric FORMULA  on FORMULA .
FORMULA  is locally conformally equivalent to a local parallel metric,
by Proposition REF .
The non-degeneracy of FORMULA  then implies that FORMULA  for some
FORMULA . Thus FORMULA  is an exact 1-form on FORMULA .
 FORMULA
Corollary 4 A non-degenerate, locally metric connection satisfying FORMULA 
is a (globally) metric connection if and only if FORMULA  is exact.

Proposition 5 Let FORMULA  be a metric and FORMULA  a closed 1-form on FORMULA . Then
the pair FORMULA  determines a unique symmetric connection FORMULA  on FORMULA  by the equation
FORMULA 

Proof:
For each point FORMULA  in FORMULA  there exists a connected open neighbourhood FORMULA  and a
function FORMULA , determined up to a positive constant multiple,
such that FORMULA . Thus FORMULA  defines a unique symmetric
connection FORMULA  on FORMULA  by the equations FORMULA , FORMULA .
The proposition follows from the observation that the equations FORMULA ,
FORMULA , are equivalent to FORMULA .
 FORMULA
This construction generalizes the Levi-Civita connection; if FORMULA  is exact, with
FORMULA  for some FORMULA , then the symmetric connection
defined by FORMULA  is the Levi-Civita connection of FORMULA .
The symmetric connection FORMULA  determined by a pair FORMULA 
is not necessarily non-degenerate. It is easy to create
degenerate examples by considering product manifold structures. However, FORMULA  will
be non-degenerate for a generic choice of FORMULA .
Suppose FORMULA  is a symmetric, non-degenerate connection determined by both
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
By Proposition REF , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are locally conformally
equivalent to local parallel metrics and so by non-degeneracy FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are conformally equivalent to each other:
FORMULA  for some function FORMULA .
The equations FORMULA ,
for FORMULA , give FORMULA . On the other hand, FORMULA  and
FORMULA  define the same symmetric connection for any non-vanishing
function FORMULA  on FORMULA .
For the purpose of constructing locally metric connections it is often
illuminating to carry the
analysis to the universal cover FORMULA  of FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  determine the locally metric connection FORMULA  on FORMULA .
Pull FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  back to FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  on
FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
FORMULA  is exact since it is a closed form on a simply-connected manifold and so there
exists a function FORMULA  such that
FORMULA .
Put FORMULA . FORMULA  is the Levi-Civita
connection of FORMULA :
FORMULA 
For any FORMULA  there exists a connected
open neighbourhood FORMULA  of FORMULA  in FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  is the disjoint union
FORMULA 
of sheets FORMULA  each naturally diffeomorphic to FORMULA .
Given two points FORMULA  there exists
a diffeomorphism FORMULA  defined by
FORMULA 
In particular, FORMULA . Now,
FORMULA 
Since the open sets FORMULA  and FORMULA  are required to be connected, it follows that
FORMULA 
for some constant FORMULA .
Therefore
FORMULA 
Define the manifold
FORMULA 
We have shown that FORMULA  satisfies the following condition:
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA , where FORMULA 
is a locally constant function.
As the notation suggests, this condition does not depend upon the choice of
connected open neighbourhoods FORMULA .
We state this as a lemma.
Lemma 6 
Let FORMULA  be a locally metric connection on FORMULA  defined by a pair FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  is the projection of the Levi-Civita connection FORMULA  of a
metric FORMULA  on the universal cover FORMULA  of FORMULA , which
satisfies condition (REF ).

Conversely, suppose that FORMULA  is a metric on FORMULA 
satisfying condition (REF ). Clearly, its Levi-Civita connection FORMULA 
projects down to a locally metric connection FORMULA  on FORMULA . We shall demonstrate that
the projected connection FORMULA  is, in fact,
defined by a pair FORMULA . To this end we seek a function
FORMULA  for which
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be such that FORMULA .
From (REF ),
FORMULA 
Therefore
FORMULA 
For each FORMULA  fix some sheet FORMULA  in FORMULA . Define the function
FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the unique element in FORMULA  for which FORMULA .
Suppose FORMULA , with FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
That is,
FORMULA 
Therefore FORMULA  satisfies (REF ),
but is only defined on an open subset of
FORMULA . To find a positive, globally defined function FORMULA  we use a partition
of unity FORMULA  subordinate to the cover FORMULA  of
FORMULA : FORMULA , where
FORMULA .
Put
FORMULA 
Consider FORMULA  with FORMULA  and let FORMULA 
be the indices in FORMULA  for which FORMULA . Then
FORMULA , for FORMULA .
FORMULA 
as required.
Therefore FORMULA  projects to a metric FORMULA  on FORMULA :
FORMULA 
To be more precise, define FORMULA  by the pullback
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA . To show that this is well-defined,
consider FORMULA  such that FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
By similarly pulling back the equation
FORMULA 
it follows that
FORMULA 
for some closed 1-form FORMULA  on FORMULA .
Applying the previous lemma we arrive at the theorem below.
Theorem 7 Let FORMULA  be a symmetric connection on FORMULA . FORMULA  is defined by a pair
FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA  is the projection of the Levi-Civita connection FORMULA 
of a metric FORMULA  on
the universal cover FORMULA  of FORMULA , which satisfies condition (REF ).


Examples
In this section we consider two examples, both chosen for the purpose of illustration rather
than physical realism. The first will apply the procedure for
finding locally metric connections, developed in the previous section, to Robertson-Walker
spacetimes. The second highlights some of the unusual features that can arise in the
degenerate case.
                  
 Non-degenerate case  
Consider FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is the 1-sphere or circle and FORMULA  is the Klein bottle.
FORMULA  will parametrize time and FORMULA  will describe the topology of spacelike
hypersurfaces. We begin by seeking the first de Rham cohomology group of FORMULA .
The simplest case of the Poincaré Lemma is FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Also, it is well known that FORMULA .
Recall that the Klein bottle is obtained from the rectangle by identifying the edges
in the manner indicated by the arrows in the following diagram:

 FORMULA FORMULA FORMULA FORMULAThe base point FORMULA  of FORMULA  corresponds to the corners of the rectangle, which
are all identified.
By traversing the boundary of the rectangle in a counterclockwise direction we obtain a
loop based at FORMULA , which is homotopic, relative to the base point,
to the constant loop. Thus FORMULA  and the fundamental group of FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
that is, the group on two generators FORMULA  and FORMULA  subject to FORMULA .
The abelianization of the fundamental group is the abelian group generated by FORMULA  and FORMULA 
restricted by the relation FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA . Therefore
FORMULA 
The Hurewicz isomorphism then gives the first singular homology group of FORMULA  with integer
coefficients: FORMULA . By a
Universal Coefficient theorem we obtain the first singular cohomology group with coefficients
in FORMULA :
FORMULA 
According to de Rham's theorem, FORMULA  is isomorphic to FORMULA .
Hence
FORMULA 
Also, since FORMULA  is connected, FORMULA . The Künneth formula
now provides the first de Rham cohomology of FORMULA :
FORMULA 
FORMULA  may also be obtained from FORMULA  by the identifications
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are non-zero constants.
FORMULA  and FORMULA  on FORMULA  are independent,
closed forms that project to FORMULA . Since FORMULA ,
the general closed 1-form on FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are constants and FORMULA  is a positive function on FORMULA .
The Robertson-Walker spacetime for flat spacelike hypersurfaces has the form
FORMULA 
with FORMULA . It projects to a Lorentzian metric FORMULA 
on FORMULA . The pair FORMULA  determines a unique symmetric connection FORMULA  on
FORMULA  by the formula FORMULA . If FORMULA  then FORMULA  is the Levi-Civita
connection of a (global) metric on FORMULA .
From (REF ), FORMULA , for
FORMULA 
Therefore FORMULA  is the Levi-Civita connection of the local metric
FORMULA 
Let us consider the case FORMULA . On the spacelike hypersurfaces
FORMULA , (REF ) reduces to FORMULA ,
which defines a locally Levi-Civita connection
FORMULA . The non-zero Christoffel symbols for FORMULA ,
the pullback of FORMULA  to the universal cover FORMULA  of FORMULA , are
FORMULA 
These are invariant with respect to the transformations
FORMULA 
verifying that FORMULA  is, in fact, defined on FORMULA .
It is worth pointing out that a similar exploration performed on FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  signifies the 3-torus, underscores some further characteristics analogous
to metric geometry. In this case, we find that given any two points on a spacelike
hypersurface FORMULA , one can be mapped to the other by a translation on FORMULA ,
which preserves the locally metric connection. This naturally extends the notion of
homogeneity to locally metric spacetimes.
                  
 Degenerate case   Consider the Lorentzian metric
FORMULA 
on FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
FORMULA  is the metric of a product of (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds, so
the Levi-Civita connection FORMULA  of FORMULA  is degenerate.
Let FORMULA  be the quotient manifold of FORMULA  with respect to the
identifications
FORMULA 
Topologically, FORMULA  is the product of an infinite cylinder with the plane.
Since FORMULA , the connection FORMULA  projects
down to a locally, but not globally, metric connection FORMULA  on FORMULA ; indeed,
the non-zero Christoffel symbols
FORMULA 
of FORMULA  are invariant with respect to the transformation
FORMULA  on FORMULA .
FORMULA  is not defined by FORMULA  for any pair FORMULA .
Were it so, there would exist a positive function FORMULA  and a parallel metric
FORMULA 
on the universal cover FORMULA  of FORMULA  such that FORMULA 
projects to FORMULA  on FORMULA . The most general metric on FORMULA ,
parallel with respect to FORMULA , is of the form
FORMULA 
for constants FORMULA  and FORMULA  satisfying FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
If FORMULA  were the pullback FORMULA  of a metric FORMULA  on FORMULA 
then we would have FORMULA , implying FORMULA .
Furthermore, the causal structure on FORMULA  is ambiguous. One might consider specifying a
causal structure about a point FORMULA  on FORMULA  by a choice of parallel metric
in a neighbourhood of FORMULA , given by (REF ).
Following this metric along
the loop FORMULA , for FORMULA ,
results in a second causal structure about FORMULA  determined by
FORMULA
