smoothings of singularities, real plane curves, Harnack
curves

Introduction
The 16th problem of Hilbert addresses the determination and the
understanding of the possible topological types of smooth real
algebraic curves of a given degree in the projective plane FORMULA . This paper is concerned with a local version of this
problem: given a germ FORMULA  of real algebraic plane curve
singularity, determine the possible topological types of the
smoothings of FORMULA . A smoothing of FORMULA  is a real analytic
family FORMULA , for FORMULA , such that FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is non singular and transversal to the boundary of a Milnor
ball FORMULA  of the singularity FORMULA  for FORMULA . In this
case the real part FORMULA  of FORMULA  consists of finitely many
ovals and non closed components in the Milnor ball.
In the algebraic case it was shown by Harnack that a real
projective curve of degree FORMULA  has at most FORMULA  connected components. A curve with this number of components
is called a FORMULA -curve. In the local case there is a similar bound,
depending on the number of real branches of the singularity (see
Section REF ), which arises from the application of the
classical topological theory of Smith. A smoothing which reaches
this bound on the number of connected components is called a
FORMULA -smoothing. It should be noticed that in the local case
FORMULA -smoothings do not always exists (see {{cite:814c48f3-6711-48c5-ae4b-f59810f90b7e}}). One relevant
open problem in the theory is to determine the actual maximal
number of components of a smoothing of FORMULA , for FORMULA  running
in a suitable form of equisingularity class refining the classical
notion of Zariski of equisingularity class in the complex world
(see {{cite:1b397a8b-f942-4907-a924-b8ca9d4c0267}}).
Quite recently Mikhalkin has proved a beautiful topological
rigidity property of those FORMULA -curves in FORMULA  which are
embedded in maximal position with respect to the coordinate
lines (see {{cite:8a5be0da-59a5-4c1a-a090-6c6e56448956}}). His result, which holds more
generally, for those FORMULA -curves in projective toric surfaces which
are cyclically in maximal position with respect to the toric
coordinate lines, is proved by analyzing the topological
properties of the associated amoebas. The amoeba of a curve
FORMULA  is the image of the points FORMULA  in the curve
by the map FORMULA , given by FORMULA . Conceptually, the amoebas are
intermediate objects which lay in between classical algebraic
curves and tropical curves. See {{cite:42b4ef0c-050d-4d04-8cdb-5c2ea72fbb92}}, {{cite:e2d43ef0-fe17-4f76-91b6-459441af98e2}},
{{cite:8a5be0da-59a5-4c1a-a090-6c6e56448956}}, {{cite:057c4569-e074-4e93-ad8e-140196ef52ae}}, {{cite:e49af652-6000-4e75-ad0d-a371bfc00894}} and {{cite:2385e7a8-5ddd-453a-9916-6039a20f33ac}} for more on
this notion and its applications.
In this paper we study smoothings of a real plane branch
singularity FORMULA , i.e., the germ FORMULA  is analytically
irreducible in FORMULA  and admits a real Newton-Puiseux
parametrization. Risler proved that any such germ FORMULA  admits a
FORMULA -smoothing with the maximal number ovals, namely FORMULA , where FORMULA  denotes the Milnor number. The
technique used, called nowadays the blow-up method, is a
generalization of the classical Harnack construction of FORMULA -curves
by small perturbations, using the components of the exceptional
divisor as a basis of rank one (see {{cite:bd5bf0fa-cefa-4fd2-b7b5-2bbbc2f4c3c5}}, {{cite:f922bca1-7096-4c8c-b75e-8e1fd9620295}} and
{{cite:1b397a8b-f942-4907-a924-b8ca9d4c0267}}). One of our motivations was to study to which extent
Mikhalkin's result holds for smoothings of singular points of real
plane curves, particularly for Harnack smoothings, those
FORMULA -smoothings which are in maximal position with respect to two
coordinates lines through the singular point.
We develop a new construction of smoothings of a real plane branch
FORMULA  by using Viro Patchworking method. Since real plane
branches are Newton degenerated, we cannot apply Viro Patchworking
method directly. Instead we apply the Patchworking method for
certain Newton non degenerate curve singularities with
several branches which are defined by semi-quasi-homogeneous
polynomials. These singularities appear as a result of iterating
deformations of the strict transforms FORMULA , at certain
infinitely near points FORMULA  of the embedded resolution of
singularities of FORMULA . Our method yields multi-parametric
deformations, which we call multi-semi-quasi-homogeneous
(msqh) and provides simultaneously msqh-smoothings of the strict
transforms FORMULA . We exhibit suitable hypothesis which
characterize FORMULA -smoothings and Harnack smoothings for this class
of deformations (see Theorem REF ). Up to the author's
knowledge, Theorem REF  is the first instance in the
literature in which Viro Patchoworking method is used to define
smoothings of Newton degenerated singularities, with controlled
topology.
We introduce the notion of multi-Harnack smoothings, those
Harnack smoothings, such that the msqh-FORMULA -smoothings of the
strict transforms FORMULA  appearing in the process are Harnack.
We prove that any real plane branch FORMULA  admits a multi-Harnack
smoothing. For this purpose we prove the existence of Harnack
smoothings of singularities defined by certain
semi-quasi-homogeneous polynomials (see Proposition
REF ). One of our main results, Theorem
REF , states that multi-Harnack smoothings of a real
plane branch FORMULA  have a unique topological type, which depends
only on the complex equisingular class of FORMULA . In particular,
multi-Harnack smoothings do not have nested ovals. Theorem
REF  can be understood as a local version of Mikhalkin's
Theorem REF . The proof is based on Theorem REF 
and an extension of Mikhalkin's result for Harnack smoothings of
certain non-degenerated singular points (Theorem REF ).
We also analyze certain multi-scaled regions containing the ovals.
The phenomena is quite analog to the analysis of the asymptotic
concentration of the curvature of the Milnor fibers in the complex
case, due to García Barroso and Teissier {{cite:4aa400ba-bd25-4b82-be75-14eff294f963}}.
It is a challenge for the future to extend, as possible, the
techniques and results of this paper to the constructions of
smoothings of other singular points of real plane curves.
The paper is organized as follows. The five first sections are
preliminary material: in Sections , 
and  we introduce the Viro Patchworking method, also in
the toric context; we recall Mikhalkin's result on Harnack curves
in projective toric surfaces in Section ; the notion of
smoothings of real plane curve singular points is presented in
section . Section 
contains the first new results, in particular, the determination
of the topological type of Harnack smoothings of singularities
defined by certain non degenerated semi-quasi-homogeneous
polynomials (see Theorem REF ). In Section 
we recall the construction of a toric resolution of a plane branch
and we introduce the support of the msqh-smoothings, which are
studied in the last section. The main results of the paper are
collected in Section : the characterization of maximal,
Harnack and multi-Harnack-msqh-smoothings in Theorem REF 
and Corollary REF , and the characterization of the
topological type of multi-Harnack smoothings in Theorem
REF , the description of the scales of ovals in
Section REF  and finally some examples explained in
detail.

Basic notations and definitions
A real algebraic variety is a complex algebraic variety FORMULA 
invariant by an anti-holomorphic involution, we denote by FORMULA 
the real part. For instance, a real algebraic plane curve FORMULA  is a complex plane curve which is invariant under
complex conjugation. The curve FORMULA  is defined by FORMULA  where FORMULA . We use the following
notations and definitions:
The Newton polygon of FORMULA  (resp. the local Newton
polygon) is the convex hull in FORMULA  of the set FORMULA  (resp. of FORMULA ).
If FORMULA  we
denote by FORMULA  the symbolic restriction FORMULA .
Suppose that FORMULA  is an isolated singular point
of FORMULA  and that FORMULA  does not contain a coordinate axis. Then the
Newton diagram of FORMULA  is the closed region FORMULA  bounded by the
coordinate axis and the local Newton polygon of FORMULA .
The polynomial FORMULA  is non degenerated (resp. real non
degenerated) with respect to its Newton polygon if for any
compact face FORMULA  of it we have that FORMULA  defines
a non singular subset of FORMULA  (resp. of FORMULA ). In this
case if FORMULA  is an edge of the Newton polygon of FORMULA , then
the polynomial FORMULA  is of the form:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA , the integers FORMULA  are coprime and the numbers FORMULA , which
are called peripheral roots of FORMULA  along the edge FORMULA 
or simply peripheral roots of  FORMULA, are distinct (resp.
the real peripheral roots of FORMULA  are distinct). Notice
that the non degeneracy (resp. real non degeneracy) of FORMULA  implies
that FORMULA  is non singular (resp. FORMULA ),
for taking FORMULA  equal to the Newton polygon of FORMULA  in the
definition.
We say that FORMULA  is non degenerated (resp. real non
degenerated) with respect to its local Newton polygon if for any
edge FORMULA  of it we have that the equation FORMULA 
defines a non singular subset of FORMULA  (resp. of FORMULA ).
The notion of non degeneracy with respect to the Newton polyhedra
extend for polynomials of more than two variables (see
{{cite:8110abd3-0473-4174-802c-5e5ef8eb8d08}}).

The real part of a projective toric variety
We introduce basic notations and facts on the geometry of toric
varieties. We refer the reader to {{cite:e2d43ef0-fe17-4f76-91b6-459441af98e2}}, {{cite:0565c4db-dc2f-49b8-b1d0-ca7eed40b9ec}} and
{{cite:12ff4e82-7203-425d-87fc-57996f1b4e23}} for proofs and more general statements. For
simplicity we state the notations only for surfaces.
Let FORMULA  be a convex two dimensional polytope in FORMULA  with integral vertices, a polygon in what follows. We
associate to the polygon FORMULA  a projective toric variety
FORMULA . The algebraic torus FORMULA  is embedded as an open
set of FORMULA , and acts on FORMULA , in a way which
coincides with the group operation on the torus. There is a one to
one correspondence between the faces of FORMULA  and the orbits of
the torus action, which preserves the dimensions and the
inclusions of the closures. If FORMULA  is a one dimensional face
of FORMULA , we have an embedding FORMULA .
The variety FORMULA  is a projective line FORMULA  embedded in
FORMULA . These lines are called the coordinate lines of
FORMULA . The intersection of two coordinate lines
FORMULA  and FORMULA  reduces to a point (resp. is
empty) if and only if the edges FORMULA  and FORMULA 
intersect in a vertex of FORMULA  (resp. otherwise). The surface
FORMULA  may have singular points only at the zero-dimensional
orbits. The algebraic real torus FORMULA  is an open subset of
the real part FORMULA  of FORMULA  and acts on it. The
orbits of this action are just the real parts of the orbits for
the complex algebraic torus action. For instance if FORMULA  the
simplex with vertices FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  then the
surface FORMULA  with its coordinate lines
is the complex projective plane with the classical three
coordinate axis.
The image of the moment map FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
is FORMULA , where FORMULA  denotes
relative interior. The restriction FORMULA  is a diffeomorphism of FORMULA  onto the interior
of FORMULA .
Denote by FORMULA  the group consisting
of the orthogonal symmetries of FORMULA  with respect to the
coordinate lines, namely the elements of FORMULA  are
FORMULA , where FORMULA  for FORMULA .
If FORMULA  we denote by FORMULA  the union FORMULA .
The map FORMULA  extends to a diffeomorphism: FORMULA  by FORMULA , for FORMULA  and FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is an edge of FORMULA  and if FORMULA  is a
primitive integral vector orthogonal to FORMULA  we denote by
FORMULA  or by FORMULA  the element of FORMULA  defined by FORMULA .
We consider the equivalence relation FORMULA  in the set
FORMULA , which for each edge FORMULA  of FORMULA ,
identifies a point in FORMULA  with its symmetric image by
FORMULA . Set FORMULA  the image of
FORMULA  in FORMULA . For each edge
FORMULA  of FORMULA  we have diffeomorphisms FORMULA  and
FORMULA , corresponding to the moment map in the one
dimensional case. Notice that FORMULA  has two connected components and the real part
FORMULA  corresponds to FORMULA .
We summarize this constructions in the following result (see
{{cite:0565c4db-dc2f-49b8-b1d0-ca7eed40b9ec}} Proposition 1.8 and {{cite:e2d43ef0-fe17-4f76-91b6-459441af98e2}}, Chapter 11, Theorem 5.4
for more details and precise statements).
Proposition 2.1 
The morphisms defined from the moment map glue up ia a stratified
homeomorphism
FORMULA 
which for any edge FORMULA  of FORMULA  applies
FORMULA  to the correspondent coordinate line FORMULA . The composite
FORMULA 
is the inclusion of the real part of the torus in FORMULA .

A polynomial FORMULA  with Newton polygon equal to FORMULA  defines a
real algebraic curve FORMULA  in the real toric surface FORMULA 
which does not pass through any 0-dimensional orbit. If FORMULA  is
smooth its genus coincides with the number of integral points in
the interior of FORMULA , see {{cite:9275440a-a03f-4f31-a8c6-fd4cc7d1ebbe}}. The curve FORMULA  is a
FORMULA -curve if FORMULA  has the maximal number FORMULA  of connected components. If FORMULA  is
an edge of FORMULA  the intersection of FORMULA  with the coordinate
line FORMULA  is defined by FORMULA . The number of
zeroes of FORMULA  in the projective line FORMULA ,
counted with multiplicity, is equal to the integral length
of the segment FORMULA , i.e., one plus the number of integral
points in the interior of FORMULA . This holds since these zeroes
are the image of the peripheral roots FORMULA  of FORMULA  (see
(REF )) by the embedding map FORMULA .
For
this reason we abuse sometimes of terminology and call peripheral
roots the zeroes of FORMULA  in the projective line
FORMULA .

Patchworking real algebraic curves
Patchworking is a method introduced by Viro for constructing real
algebraic hypersurfaces (see {{cite:41954463-7ad2-4ac3-938d-bf02bd1786e7}}, {{cite:b6d82989-4cf9-4590-9748-b32b4d96d51f}} {{cite:95bc6004-f90f-48e6-bd09-0061871a570c}},
{{cite:623e458e-b347-4c18-892c-8f998833b03d}} and {{cite:92314168-136b-4bdc-9796-a30acb148f45}}, see also {{cite:e2d43ef0-fe17-4f76-91b6-459441af98e2}} and {{cite:eb5bf8bf-71f8-423e-be99-77b014a178aa}}
for an exposition and {{cite:a4df6c9f-1176-4bdf-a436-1a5e3b65786a}} and {{cite:49d23840-f068-49b4-ad76-3fb4570a4e25}} for some
generalizations). We use the Notations introduced in Section
.
Let FORMULA  be an integral polygon. The
following definition is fundamental.
Definition 3.1 
Let FORMULA  define a real algebraic curve FORMULA  then the
FORMULA -chart FORMULA  of FORMULA  is the closure of
FORMULA  in FORMULA .

If FORMULA  is the Newton polygon of FORMULA  we often denote
FORMULA  by FORMULA  or by FORMULA 
if the coordinates used are clear from the context. If FORMULA  is real
non degenerated with respect its Newton polygon, then for any face
FORMULA  of
FORMULA  we have that FORMULA  and the
intersection FORMULA  is
transversal (as stratified sets).
Notation 3.2 
We consider a polynomial FORMULA , as a family of polynomials in FORMULA .

We denote by FORMULA  the Newton polygon of
FORMULA , when FORMULA .

We denote by FORMULA  the Newton polytope of FORMULA , when it is viewed
as a polynomial in FORMULA .

We denote by FORMULA  the lower part of FORMULA , i.e.,
the union of compact faces of the Minkowski sum FORMULA .

The restriction of the second projection FORMULA  to FORMULA  induces a finite
strictly convex polyhedral subdivision FORMULA  of FORMULA . The
inverse function FORMULA  is a
piece-wise affine strictly convex function. Any cell
FORMULA  of the subdivision FORMULA  corresponds by this
function to a face FORMULA  of FORMULA  contained in
FORMULA , of the same dimension, and the converse also
holds. The Newton polygon of FORMULA  is a face of FORMULA  by
construction.

If FORMULA  is a cell of FORMULA  we denote
by FORMULA , or by FORMULA  the
polynomial in FORMULA  obtained by substituting FORMULA  in
FORMULA .


Theorem 3.1  With the above notations,
if for each face FORMULA  of FORMULA  contained in
FORMULA  the polynomial FORMULA  is
real non degenerated with respect to FORMULA , then the pair FORMULA  is stratified
homeomorphic to FORMULA , where FORMULA 
is the curve obtained by gluing together in FORMULA  the
charts FORMULA  for
FORMULA  running through the cells of the subdivision FORMULA ,
for FORMULA .

Remark 3.3 
The statement of Theorem REF  above is a slight
generalization of the original result of Viro in which the
deformation is of the form FORMULA ,
for some real coefficients FORMULA . The same proof generalize
without relevant changes to the case presented here, when we may
add terms FORMULA  with FORMULA  and
exponents FORMULA  contained in FORMULA .

Remark 3.4 
Theorem REF  extends naturally to provide constructions of
real algebraic curves with prescribed topology in the real toric
surface FORMULA . The chart FORMULA  of the curve FORMULA  in FORMULA  is defined as the closure
of FORMULA  in FORMULA  (where
FORMULA  is the equivalence relation defined in Section
). Then the statement of Theorem REF  holds for
the curve FORMULA  defined by FORMULA  in FORMULA  by identifying
FORMULA  and FORMULA  by the map FORMULA 
(see (REF )).

Definition 3.5 The gluing of charts of Theorem REF  is called combinatorial patchworking if the subdivision FORMULA  is a primitive triangulation of FORMULA , i.e., it contains all
integral points of FORMULA  as vertices.

Notice that FORMULA  is a primitive triangulation if the two
dimensional cells FORMULA  are primitive triangles, i.e., of area
FORMULA  with respect to the standard volume form induced by a basis
of the lattice FORMULA . The description of the charts of a
combinatorial patchworking is determined by the subdivision
FORMULA  and the signs of the terms appearing in FORMULA  as a polynomial in FORMULA  and FORMULA . The distribution of signs FORMULA , induced by taking the signs of the terms appearing in
FORMULA , extends to
FORMULA 
The chart associated to the polynomial FORMULA  in a triangle is
empty if all the signs are equal and otherwise is isotopic to
segment dividing the triangle in two parts, each one containing
only vertices of the same sign. See {{cite:e2d43ef0-fe17-4f76-91b6-459441af98e2}}, {{cite:92314168-136b-4bdc-9796-a30acb148f45}},
{{cite:1dd2fb12-3ab9-4bf2-8eea-e78726cafe4d}}.

Maximal and Harnack curves in projective toric
surfaces
If FORMULA  is a smooth real projective curve of degree FORMULA  then the
classical Harnack inequality states that the number of connected
components of its real part FORMULA  is bounded by
FORMULA . The curve FORMULA  is called maximal or
FORMULA -curve if the number of components is equal to the bound.
Maximal curves always exists and geometric constructions of such
curves were found in particular by Harnack, Hilbert and Brusotti.
Determining the possible topological types of the pairs FORMULA  in terms of the degree FORMULA  is usually called the first part
of the Hilbert's 16th problem.
Definition 4.1 
A real projective curve FORMULA  of degree d is in

maximal position with respect to a real line FORMULA 
if the intersection FORMULA  is transversal, FORMULA  and FORMULA  is contained in one connected component of
FORMULA .

maximal position with respect to real lines
FORMULA  in FORMULA  if FORMULA  is in maximal position with
respect to FORMULA , and there exist FORMULA  disjoint arcs
FORMULA  contained in one connected
component of FORMULA  such that FORMULA , for FORMULA .


Mikhalkin studied the topological types of the triples
FORMULA  for those
FORMULA -curves FORMULA  in maximal position with respect to lines FORMULA . He proved that for FORMULA  there is a unique
topological type, while for FORMULA  there is none. For FORMULA  the
classification reduces to the topological classification of
maximal curves in the real affine plane (which is open for FORMULA ), while for FORMULA  there are several constructions of FORMULA -curves
of degree FORMULA , which were found by Brusotti, with FORMULA . See
{{cite:e6163aa7-d27d-498b-bf9d-b4789e8a15ff}} and {{cite:8a5be0da-59a5-4c1a-a090-6c6e56448956}}.
Mikhalkin's results were stated and proved more generally for
real algebraic curves in projective toric surfaces. We denote by
FORMULA  the sequence of cyclically incident coordinate
lines in the toric surface FORMULA  associated to the polygon
FORMULA . The notion of maximal position of a real algebraic
curve FORMULA  with respect one line is the same as
in the projective case.
Definition 4.2 A real algebraic curve FORMULA  in the toric surface FORMULA  is in
maximal position with respect to lines
FORMULA , for FORMULA , if there exist FORMULA  disjoint arcs FORMULA  contained in one connected component of FORMULA 
such that the
intersection FORMULA  is transversal and contained in
FORMULA , while FORMULA  if FORMULA , for FORMULA  and FORMULA . In addition, we say that:

The curve FORMULA  is cyclically in maximal position
if it is in maximal position with respect to the lines FORMULA  and the points of intersection of FORMULA  with the
lines FORMULA  when viewed in the connected component of
FORMULA  are partially ordered, following the adjacency of the lines
FORMULA  .

The curve
FORMULA  has good oscillation with respect to the line FORMULA  if the
points of intersection of FORMULA  with FORMULA  have the same order when
viewed in the arc FORMULA  and in the line FORMULA .


Remark 4.3 If FORMULA  is in maximal position with respect to
the coordinate line FORMULA , for FORMULA  an edge of
FORMULA , we say also that the chart FORMULA  is in maximal position with respect to FORMULA 
(see Proposition REF ).

We have the following result of Mikhalkin (see {{cite:8a5be0da-59a5-4c1a-a090-6c6e56448956}}).
Theorem 4.1 
With the above notations if a FORMULA -curve FORMULA  is cyclically in
maximal position with respect to the coordinate lines FORMULA  of the real toric surface FORMULA  then the topological
type of the triple FORMULA  depends only
on FORMULA .

Definition 4.4 A Harnack curve in the real toric surface FORMULA  is a real
algebraic curve FORMULA  verifying the conclusion of Theorem
REF .

Remark 4.5

The notion of Harnack curve in this case depends on the
polygon FORMULA . Changing FORMULA  by FORMULA , for FORMULA 
provides the same toric variety but the corresponding Harnack
curves are different.

By our convention and the definitions, the Newton polygon of
a polynomial FORMULA , defining a Harnack curve FORMULA  is equal to FORMULA . Notice also that FORMULA  is non
degenerated with respect to FORMULA  and for any edge FORMULA  of
FORMULA  the peripheral roots of FORMULA  along the edge FORMULA  are
real and of the same sign (see (REF )).


If FORMULA 
defines a Harnack curve in FORMULA  we denote by FORMULA  the
unique connected component of FORMULA  which intersects the
coordinate lines and by
FORMULA  the set FORMULA , where FORMULA  runs through the connected components of the set
FORMULA , whose boundary meets at most two
coordinate lines. The set FORMULA  is an open region
bounding FORMULA  and the coordinate lines of the toric surface.
The following Proposition, which is a reformulation of the
results of Mikhalkin {{cite:8a5be0da-59a5-4c1a-a090-6c6e56448956}}, describes completely the
topological type of the real part of a Harnack curve in a toric
surface. See Figure REF  below an example.
Proposition 4.6 
With the previous notations, if FORMULA  defines a Harnack curve in
FORMULA  then FORMULA  is cyclically in maximal position with good
oscillation with respect to the coordinate lines of the toric
surface FORMULA . Moreover, the set of connected components of
FORMULA  can be labelled as FORMULA  in such a way that:
- there exists a unique FORMULA 
such that for any FORMULA :
FORMULA 
- the set of components FORMULA  consists of non nested ovals in FORMULA .
- if FORMULA  then the
intersection of closures FORMULA  reduces to a point in FORMULA  if
and only if FORMULA  and FORMULA  are consecutive integral points
in FORMULA  for some edge FORMULA  of FORMULA , or it is empty
otherwise.
- we have that FORMULA .

The following Proposition describes the construction of Harnack
curve in the real toric surface FORMULA  by using combinatorial
patchworking (see {{cite:1dd2fb12-3ab9-4bf2-8eea-e78726cafe4d}} Proposition 3.1 and
{{cite:8a5be0da-59a5-4c1a-a090-6c6e56448956}} Corollary A4).
Definition 4.7 
Denote by FORMULA  the function
FORMULA . A Harnack
distribution of signs is any of the following distributions FORMULA , where FORMULA  (see (REF )).

Proposition 4.8 
Let FORMULA  be a Harnack distribution of signs and FORMULA  define a primitive triangulation of
FORMULA , then the polynomial
FORMULA 
defines a Harnack curve in FORMULA , for FORMULA .

Proof. Suppose without loss of generality that FORMULA . Since the triangulation is primitive any triangle FORMULA 
containing a vertex with both even coordinates, which we call even
vertex, has the other two vertices with at least one odd
coordinate. It follows that the even vertex has a sign different
than the two other vertices. If the even vertex is in the interior
of FORMULA  then there is necessarily an oval around it, resulting
of the combinatorial patchworking. The situations in the other
quadrants is analogous by the symmetry of the Harnack distribution
of signs since, for each triangle FORMULA , for any vertex FORMULA 
there is a unique symmetry FORMULA  such that the sign of
FORMULA  is different than the sign of the two other
vertices of FORMULA . It follows that there are FORMULA  ovals which do not cut the
coordinate lines and exactly one more component which has good
oscillation with maximal position with respect to the coordinate
lines of FORMULA .  FORMULA

Smoothings of real plane singular points
Let FORMULA  be a germ of real plane curve with an isolated
singular point at the origin. Set FORMULA  for the
ball
of center 0 and of radius FORMULA . If FORMULA 
each branch of FORMULA  intersects FORMULA 
transversally along a smooth circle and the same property holds
when the radius is decreased (analogous statements hold also for
the real part). Then we denote the ball FORMULA  by
FORMULA , and we called it a Milnor ball for FORMULA . See
{{cite:c620b763-8fc0-4568-826e-10b3f41e811f}}).
A smoothing FORMULA  is a real analytic
family FORMULA , for FORMULA  such that FORMULA 
and FORMULA  for FORMULA  is non singular and transversal to
the boundary. By the connected components of the smoothing FORMULA 
we mean the components of the real part FORMULA  of FORMULA  in the
Milnor ball. These components consist of finitely many ovals and
non closed connected components.
Definition 5.1

The topological type of a smoothing FORMULA  of a
plane curve singularity FORMULA  with Milnor ball FORMULA  is
the topological type of the pair FORMULA .

The signed topological type of a smoothing
FORMULA  of a plane curve singularity FORMULA  with Milnor ball FORMULA  with respect to fixed coordinates FORMULA  is the
topological type of the pairs, FORMULA , for FORMULA , where FORMULA 
denotes the open quadrant FORMULA .


A branch of FORMULA  is real if it has a Newton Puiseux
parametrization with real coefficients. Denote by FORMULA  the number
of (complex analytic) branches of FORMULA . The number of non
closed components is equal to FORMULA , the number of real
branches of FORMULA . The number of ovals of a smoothing FORMULA  is
FORMULA  if FORMULA  and FORMULA  if FORMULA ; where FORMULA 
denotes the Milnor number of FORMULA  at the origin (see {{cite:a940d377-29ca-42c3-bde9-c90303e3f789}},
{{cite:bd5bf0fa-cefa-4fd2-b7b5-2bbbc2f4c3c5}}, {{cite:814c48f3-6711-48c5-ae4b-f59810f90b7e}} and {{cite:f922bca1-7096-4c8c-b75e-8e1fd9620295}}). A smoothing is called a
FORMULA -smoothing if the number of ovals is equal to the bound.
The existence of FORMULA -smoothings is a quite subtle problem, for
instance if FORMULA  is a real plane branch there exists always a
FORMULA -smoothing (see {{cite:bd5bf0fa-cefa-4fd2-b7b5-2bbbc2f4c3c5}}) however there exists singularities
which do not have a FORMULA -smoothing (see {{cite:814c48f3-6711-48c5-ae4b-f59810f90b7e}}). Some other
types of real plane singularities which do have a FORMULA -smoothing
are described in {{cite:f922bca1-7096-4c8c-b75e-8e1fd9620295}} and {{cite:1b397a8b-f942-4907-a924-b8ca9d4c0267}}.
Patchworking smoothings of plane curve singularities
With the notations as above we consider a family of polynomials
FORMULA  such that FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  defining a smoothing FORMULA  of the germ of plane curve
singularity FORMULA  of equation FORMULA . Then the germ
FORMULA  does not contain any of the coordinate axis and FORMULA  for FORMULA . The Newton diagram FORMULA  of FORMULA  is contained
in the Newton polygon FORMULA  of FORMULA , for FORMULA .
The following result is a consequence of Theorem REF , see
{{cite:623e458e-b347-4c18-892c-8f998833b03d}}, {{cite:b6d82989-4cf9-4590-9748-b32b4d96d51f}} and {{cite:1b397a8b-f942-4907-a924-b8ca9d4c0267}}.
Theorem 5.1  With Notations REF ,
the family FORMULA  defines a
convex subdivision FORMULA  of FORMULA  in polygons. If
FORMULA  are the cells of FORMULA  contained
in FORMULA  and if
FORMULA  is real non degenerated
with respect to FORMULA  for FORMULA , then the family
FORMULA  defines a smoothing FORMULA  of FORMULA  such that the pairs
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
homeomorphic (in a stratified sense), for FORMULA .

The hypothesis of Theorem REF  imply that FORMULA  is real
non degenerated with respect to its local Newton polygon.

Semi-quasi-homogeneous smoothings
We say that a polynomial FORMULA , with FORMULA  is
semi-quasi-homogeneous (sqh)
if its local Newton polygon has only one compact edge.
Notation 5.2 
Consider a sqh-polynomial FORMULA  with Newton polygon
with compact edge FORMULA  and Newton diagram
FORMULA . We denote by FORMULA  the set FORMULA . The number FORMULA 
is equal to the
integral length of the segment FORMULA . We set FORMULA 
and FORMULA . Notice that the polynomial FORMULA  is of the
following form:
FORMULA 
where the exponents FORMULA  of the terms which are not
written verify that FORMULA .
Denote
by FORMULA  the set FORMULA .

Suppose that all the peripheral roots FORMULA  of FORMULA 
are real and different. In this case, using Kouchnirenko's
expression for the Milnor number of FORMULA  (see {{cite:8110abd3-0473-4174-802c-5e5ef8eb8d08}}), we
deduce that the bound on the number of connected components (resp.
ovals) of a smoothing of FORMULA  is equal to
FORMULA 
We consider a uniparametrical family of polynomials FORMULA 
with real coefficients with FORMULA  and FORMULA  of
the form (REF ).
Consider the lower part FORMULA  of the Newton polyhedra
of FORMULA  viewed as a polynomial in FORMULA . The projection
of the faces of FORMULA  define a polygonal subdivision
FORMULA  of the Newton polygon FORMULA  of FORMULA ,
viewed as a polynomial in the variables FORMULA  and FORMULA . See
Notations REF .
Definition 5.3 
We say that FORMULA  is a semi-quasi-homogeneous (sqh) deformation
(resp. smoothing) of FORMULA  if FORMULA  is a face of the subdivision
FORMULA  (resp. and in addition the polynomial
FORMULA  is real non degenerated).

Notice that if FORMULA  is a sqh-deformation the polynomial
FORMULA  is quasi-homogeneous as a polynomial in FORMULA . This implies that any non zero monomial of
FORMULA  is of the form FORMULA 
where the ratio of FORMULA  by FORMULA  is some positive
constant for all FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is real non degenerated then the real
peripheral roots of FORMULA  are all different. It follows
that FORMULA  defines a smoothing of FORMULA  by Theorem
REF .
In {{cite:623e458e-b347-4c18-892c-8f998833b03d}} Viro introduces sqh-smoothing as follows: Suppose
that FORMULA , is non degenerated with respect to its
Newton polygon FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the
function:
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  defines a sqh-smoothing of FORMULA . For
technical reasons we consider in Definition REF  a slightly
more general notion, by allowing terms which depend on FORMULA  and
which have exponents above the lower part of the Newton polyhedron
of FORMULA , viewed in FORMULA 
(cf. Notations REF ).

Size of ovals of sqh-smoothings
In this Section we consider some remarks about the sizes of ovals
of sqh-smoothing FORMULA  of FORMULA  We say that FORMULA 
if there exists a non zero constant FORMULA  such that FORMULA  when FORMULA  tends to 0.
Definition 5.4 
An oval of FORMULA  is of size FORMULA  if it is contained in a
minimal box of edges parallel to the coordinate axis such that
each vertex of the box has coordinates of the form FORMULA .

Proposition 5.5 
Let FORMULA  is a sqh-smoothing of FORMULA . If the sqh-smoothing is
described with Notations REF , then each oval of the
smoothing is of size FORMULA .

Proof. The critical points of the projection FORMULA , given by FORMULA , are those defined by
FORMULA  and FORMULA . The critical
values of this projection are defined by zeroes in FORMULA  of the
discriminant FORMULA . Using the non degeneracy conditions on
the edges of the local Newton polyhedron of FORMULA , viewed
as a polynomial in FORMULA  and ThÃ©orÃ¨me 4 in {{cite:2fd89fa2-6d2f-4698-b5b9-1210eb23dd8a}} we
deduce that the local Newton polygon of FORMULA , as a
polynomial in FORMULA  has only two vertices: FORMULA  and FORMULA . It follows by the Newton-Puiseux Theorem that the
roots of the discriminant FORMULA  as a polynomial in FORMULA ,
express as fractional power series of the form:
FORMULA 
which correspond to the root FORMULA  of FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
which correspond to the non zero roots FORMULA  of
FORMULA  (counted with multiplicity). The critical values of the
smoothing are among those described by (REF ). The critical
values (REF ) correspond to slight perturbations of critical
values of FORMULA , outside the Milnor ball of
FORMULA .
We argue in a similar manner for the projection FORMULA , given by FORMULA .  FORMULA

Harnack smoothings
We generalize the notions of maximal position and good
oscillation and Harnack, introduced in Section ,
to the case of smoothings as follows:
Definition 6.1

A smoothing FORMULA  of FORMULA  is in maximal
position (resp. has good oscillation) with respect to a line FORMULA 
passing through the origin if there exists FORMULA  different
points of intersection of FORMULA  with FORMULA , which tend to 0 as
the parameter FORMULA  tends to 0, and which are all contained in
an arc FORMULA  of the smoothing (resp. FORMULA 
is in maximal position and the order of the points in FORMULA  is the same when the points are viewed in the line FORMULA  or
in the arc FORMULA ), for all FORMULA .

A smoothing FORMULA  of FORMULA  is in maximal
position with respect to two lines FORMULA  passing through the
origin if it is in maximal position with respect to the lines
FORMULA  and FORMULA  and if the FORMULA  points of intersection of
FORMULA  with FORMULA , which tend to 0 as the parameter FORMULA 
tends to 0, are all contained in an arc FORMULA  of
the smoothing FORMULA  , for FORMULA , such that
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are disjoint and
contained in the same component of the smoothing FORMULA , for all
FORMULA .

A Harnack smoothing is a FORMULA -smoothing which is in
maximal position with good oscillation with respect to the lines
FORMULA  and FORMULA .


FIGURE 
Remark 6.2 Every real
plane branch admits a Harnack smoothing (this result is implicit
in the blow up method of {{cite:bd5bf0fa-cefa-4fd2-b7b5-2bbbc2f4c3c5}}).

The case of non degenerated sqh-polynomials with peripheral roots of the same sign
We consider the case of a plane curve singularity FORMULA  defined
by a semi-quasi-homogeneous polynomial FORMULA  such
that the peripheral roots associated to the compact edge of its
local Newton polygon are all real, different and of the same sign.
We prove that there exists a Harnack smoothing FORMULA  of FORMULA 
constructed by Patchworking. This result is quite similar to
{{cite:1b397a8b-f942-4907-a924-b8ca9d4c0267}} Theorem 4.1 (1), where under the same hypothesis, they
prove that a FORMULA -smoothing exists. We prove then that the
embedded topological type of the Harnack smoothing of FORMULA  is
unique.
We keep Notations REF  in the description of the
polynomial FORMULA .
Existence of Harnack smoothings
Lemma 6.3 
There exists a piece-wise affine linear convex function FORMULA , which takes integral values on FORMULA , vanishes on FORMULA  and induces a triangulation
of FORMULA  with the following properties:

All the integral points in FORMULA  are vertices of the
triangulation.

There exists exactly one triangle FORMULA  in the
triangulation which contains FORMULA  as an edge. The triangle FORMULA 
is transformed by a translation and a FORMULA -transformation
into the triangle FORMULA .

If FORMULA  is in the triangulation then FORMULA  is
primitive.


Proof. With the above notations take FORMULA  the
closest integral point to FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the
triangle with vertices FORMULA  (see Figure REF ).
Then assertion (ii) follows. It is then easy to construct a convex
triangulation of FORMULA  which contains FORMULA  and which is primitive on
FORMULA  (see {{cite:1b397a8b-f942-4907-a924-b8ca9d4c0267}}).  FORMULA
FIGURE 
We say that a distribution of signs FORMULA  is compatible
with a polynomial FORMULA  if
FORMULA .
Proposition 6.4  With the above notations,
let FORMULA  be a semi-quasi-homogeneous polynomial
defining a plane curve singularity FORMULA . If the peripheral
roots of FORMULA  are all different and of the same sign,
then there are two Harnack distribution of signs, FORMULA 
and FORMULA , which are compatible with FORMULA . Let
FORMULA  be as in Lemma REF . Then the polynomial
FORMULA 
defines a Harnack smoothing of FORMULA , for FORMULA .

Proof. We keep Notations REF . We suppose
without loss of generality that the peripheral roots of FORMULA 
are all positive. Then the signs of the coefficients
corresponding to consecutive terms in the edge FORMULA  are always
different. By a simple observation on the set of Harnack
distribution of signs it follows that there exists precisely two
different Harnack distribution of signs FORMULA 
which are compatible with FORMULA  (see Definition
REF ). Since FORMULA  by definition of FORMULA  (see Section
) the distributions of signs FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are related by FORMULA .
We use notations REF . Let FORMULA  be a piece-wise affine convex function satisfying
the statement of Lemma REF . By Lemma REF  the
chart of FORMULA  is transformed by a translation and a
FORMULA -transformation to the chart of a polynomial with
Newton polygon with vertices FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , i.e.,
to the chart of the graph of a polynomial of one variable with
FORMULA  different positive real roots . The topology of this chart is
determined by the sign of the term corresponding to FORMULA . Let
FORMULA  be a convex piece-wise affine function
determined by its integral values on FORMULA . We can assume
that FORMULA  induces a primitive triangulation of FORMULA  and of FORMULA  the functions FORMULA  and FORMULA  define
the same primitive triangulation (by translating FORMULA  we can
assume that FORMULA , then define FORMULA  as FORMULA  on
FORMULA  and FORMULA  be strictly convex piece
wise-linear and positive).
The topology of the chart of
FORMULA  coincides with the topology of the chart of
the polynomial FORMULA .
Notice that the patchworking
of FORMULA  is combinatorial for all triangles FORMULA  of the
subdivision with the possible exception of FORMULA . It follows from
Theorem REF  that the signed topological type of the
smoothing FORMULA  coincides with that of the smoothing defined by
FORMULA 
which is constructed by combinatorial patchworking. It follows
that the polynomial FORMULA  defines a Harnack curve
in the toric surface FORMULA , by Proposition REF .
Therefore FORMULA  defines then a Harnack smoothing of FORMULA  with
FORMULA  ovals and FORMULA  non compact
components.  FORMULA

The topological type of a Harnack
smoothing
Theorem 6.1 
Let FORMULA  be a plane curve singularity defined by a
semi-quasi-homogeneous polynomial FORMULA  non
degenerated with respect to its local Newton polygon. We denote by
FORMULA  the compact edge of this polygon. We suppose that the
peripheral roots of FORMULA  are all real. Let FORMULA  define
a semi-quasi-homogeneous FORMULA -smoothing of FORMULA  such that FORMULA 
is in maximal position with respect to the coordinate lines. If
FORMULA  denotes a Milnor ball for FORMULA  then we have that:

The peripheral roots of FORMULA  are of the same
sign.

The polynomial FORMULA  defines a Harnack
curve in FORMULA .

The smoothing FORMULA  is Harnack.

There is a unique topological type of triples FORMULA .

The topological type of the smoothing FORMULA  is
determined by FORMULA .


Proof. We follow Notations REF  to describe
the polynomial FORMULA .
Since the peripheral roots of the polynomial FORMULA  are
all real it follows that the singularity FORMULA  has exactly FORMULA 
analytic branches which are all real. It follows that the
smoothing FORMULA  has FORMULA  non closed components. If FORMULA  is
FORMULA -smoothing there are precisely FORMULA  ovals by (REF ). Since the smoothing FORMULA  is
Harnack, i.e., it is in maximal position with respect to the
coordinate axis, none of these ovals cuts the coordinate axis.
We consider the curve FORMULA  defined by the polynomial
FORMULA  in the real toric surface FORMULA . By
Theorem REF  and Remark REF  there are exactly
FORMULA  ovals in the chart
FORMULA . These ovals, when viewed in the
toric surface FORMULA  by Proposition REF , do not meet any
of the coordinate lines of FORMULA . By the same argument we have
that the curve FORMULA 
is in maximal position with respect to
the two coordinate lines FORMULA  and FORMULA  of FORMULA , corresponding
respectively to the vertical and horizontal edges of FORMULA . It
follows that the number of components of FORMULA  is FORMULA , which is equal to the
maximal number of components, hence FORMULA  is a FORMULA -curve in
FORMULA .
We deduce that the non compact connected components of FORMULA  glue up in one connected
component of FORMULA . This component contains all the
intersection points with the coordinate lines of FORMULA , since
FORMULA  is in maximal position with respect to the lines FORMULA 
and FORMULA , and by assumption the peripheral roots of FORMULA 
are all real.
By definition of maximal position with respect to two lines, there
is exactly one component of the smoothing FORMULA  containing all
the points of intersection of FORMULA  with the coordinate axis. We
deduce the following assertion by translating this information in
terms of the chart of FORMULA , using Theorem REF  and
Proposition REF : there are two disjoint arcs
FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA  containing
respectively the points of intersection of FORMULA  with the
toric axis FORMULA  and FORMULA , which do not contain any point in FORMULA  (otherwise there would be more than one non compact
component of the smoothing FORMULA  intersecting the coordinate axis,
contrary to the assumption of maximal position). It follows from
this that the curve FORMULA  is in maximal position with
respect to the coordinate axis in FORMULA . Mikhalkin's Theorem
REF  implies the second assertion. Then the other three
assertions are deduced from this by Theorem REF  and
Proposition REF .  FORMULA
Remark 6.5  With the hypothesis and notations of Theorem REF ,
we have that the connected components FORMULA , for FORMULA , of chart FORMULA ,
are described by Proposition REF . If the peripheral
roots of FORMULA  are positive, up to replacing FORMULA  by
FORMULA , one can always have that FORMULA  and then:
FORMULA 
Otherwise, we have that:
FORMULA 
Compare in Figure REF  the position of FORMULA  in
(A) and (B).

Definition 6.6 
If (REF ) holds then we say that the
signed topological type of the smoothing FORMULA  (or of the chart of
FORMULA ), is normalized (cf. Definition
REF ).

As an immediate corollary of Theorem REF  we deduce that:
Proposition 6.7 
There are two signed topological types of sqh-FORMULA -smoothings of
FORMULA  in maximal position with respect to the coordinate axis.
These types are related by the orthogonal symmetry FORMULA  and
only one of them is normalized.

FIGURE 
One of the aims of this paper is to study to which extent Theorem
REF  admits a valid formulation in the class of real plane
branch singularities. In general the singularities of this class
are degenerated with respect to their local Newton polygon, in
particular we cannot apply Viro's method to those cases.
Classically smoothing of this type of singularities is constructed
using the blow up construction. We present in the following
sections an alternative method which applies Viro method at a
sequence of certain infinitely near points.

A reminder on toric resolutions of real plane
branches
We recall the construction of an embedded resolution of
singularities of a real plane branch by a sequence of local toric
modifications. For details see {{cite:37ad63f9-3ee5-4baf-ac74-e32a4707d433}} and {{cite:6e83c113-4abc-491c-8f23-21498ffcb378}}. See

A germ FORMULA  of real plane curve, defined by FORMULA  for FORMULA , defines a real plane branch if it is analytically
irreducible in FORMULA  and if it admits a real Newton Puiseux
parametrization (normalization map):
FORMULA 
If the coordinate line FORMULA  is not tangent to FORMULA  then FORMULA  is the multiplicity of FORMULA . By
(REF ) and a suitable change of coordinates, we
have that FORMULA  has an equation FORMULA , with
FORMULA 
such that FORMULA , the integer FORMULA  is the intersection multiplicity with the line, FORMULA , and
the terms which are not written have exponents FORMULA  such that
FORMULA , i.e., they lie above the compact edge
FORMULA 
of the local Newton
polygon of FORMULA .
The vector FORMULA  is orthogonal to FORMULA 
and defines a subdivision of the positive quadrant FORMULA , which is obtained by adding the ray FORMULA .
The quadrant FORMULA  is subdivided in two cones, FORMULA , for FORMULA 
and FORMULA  the canonical basis of FORMULA . We
define the minimal regular subdivision FORMULA  of
FORMULA  which contains the ray FORMULA  by
adding the rays defined by those integral vectors in FORMULA ,
which belong to the boundary of the convex hull of the sets FORMULA , for FORMULA . We denote by FORMULA 
the unique
cone of FORMULA  of the form, FORMULA  where FORMULA  satisfies
that:
FORMULA 
See an example in Figure REF .
FIGURE 
By convenience we denote FORMULA  by FORMULA .
We define in the sequel
a sequence of proper birational maps FORMULA , for FORMULA  such that the composition FORMULA  is an embedded resolution of the germ
FORMULA , i.e., the pull back of the germ FORMULA  by FORMULA  is a normal crossing divisor in the smooth surface
FORMULA .
In order to describe these maps we denote the coordinates FORMULA 
by FORMULA  and the origin FORMULA  by FORMULA . We
also denote FORMULA  by FORMULA  and FORMULA  by FORMULA . The
subdivision FORMULA  defines a proper birational map FORMULA , which is obtained by gluing maps FORMULA , where FORMULA  runs through the set of two
dimensional cones in FORMULA . For instance, the map FORMULA  is defined by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are canonical coordinates for the affine space
FORMULA .
It should be noticed that the map FORMULA  is a composition of
point blow-ups, as many as rays added in FORMULA  to
subdivide FORMULA . Each ray FORMULA  corresponds bijectively to a projective line FORMULA ,
embedded as an irreducible component of the exceptional divisor
FORMULA . We denote by FORMULA  the exceptional
divisor defined by FORMULA  in the chart FORMULA , the other
exceptional divisor in this chart being defined by FORMULA .
Notice that the point at the infinity of the line FORMULA , for
instance, is the origin of the chart FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the two dimensional cone adjacent to FORMULA  along
the ray FORMULA .
We have that FORMULA  defines a Cartier divisor
on FORMULA . For instance, on FORMULA  it is defined by FORMULA . The term FORMULA  decomposes as:
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
The polynomial FORMULA  defines the strict
transform FORMULA  of FORMULA , i.e., the closure of the
pre-image by FORMULA  of the punctured curve FORMULA  on the chart FORMULA . The function FORMULA  defines the exceptional divisor of FORMULA  on this chart.
We analyze the intersection of the strict transform with the
exceptional divisor on the chart FORMULA : using
(REF ) we find that FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
By a similar argument on the other charts it follows that FORMULA  is
the only exceptional divisor of FORMULA  which intersects the
strict transform FORMULA  of FORMULA , precisely at the point FORMULA  of
the chart FORMULA  with coordinates FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
with intersection multiplicity equal to FORMULA . If FORMULA  then
the strict transform is smooth at FORMULA  and the intersection with
the exceptional divisor FORMULA  is transversal, hence the divisor
FORMULA  has smooth components which intersect
transversally. In this case, the map FORMULA  is an embedded
resolution of the germ FORMULA  by definition.
We define a pair of real coordinates FORMULA  at the point
FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  is defined by a polynomial, which we call the strict transform function, of the form:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA  and the
terms which are not written have exponents FORMULA  such that FORMULA , i.e., they lie above the compact edge
FORMULA  of the (local) Newton polygon of FORMULA .
The result of substituting in FORMULA , the term
FORMULA  by using (REF ), is equal to FORMULA .
We can iterate this procedure defining for FORMULA  a sequence of
toric maps FORMULA , which are
described by replacing the index 1 by FORMULA  and the index 2 by
FORMULA  above. In particular, when we refer to a Formula, like
(REF ) at level FORMULA , we mean after making this replacement.
We denote by FORMULA  the exceptional function defining the exceptional
divisor of FORMULA  on the
chart FORMULA . We have that
FORMULA 
Since by construction we have that FORMULA  (for FORMULA  denoting divides), at some step we reach a first
integer FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and then the process stops. The
composition of blow ups FORMULA  is an embedded resolution of the germ FORMULA . It is minimal, in
the number of exceptional divisors required, if one of the
coordinate axis FORMULA  or FORMULA  is not tangent to FORMULA , in
particular if FORMULA  is the multiplicity of FORMULA  (see
{{cite:37ad63f9-3ee5-4baf-ac74-e32a4707d433}}).
If FORMULA  is not tangent to FORMULA  then the sequence of pairs
FORMULA  classifies the embedded topological type
of the pair FORMULA . This is because the
FORMULA  determine and are determined by the
classical characteristic pairs of a plane branch (see {{cite:37ad63f9-3ee5-4baf-ac74-e32a4707d433}}
and {{cite:93e1ccfe-9004-450d-9531-3c90a927e1ca}}).
Example 7.1 
The embedded resolution of the real plane branch singularity FORMULA  defined by FORMULA  is as follows.

The morphism FORMULA  of the toric resolution is defined by
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA , then we have FORMULA , where FORMULA 
defines the strict transform function of FORMULA , and together with
FORMULA  defines local coordinates at the point of intersection FORMULA 
with the exceptional divisor FORMULA .
For FORMULA  we find that:
FORMULA 
Hence FORMULA  is the exceptional function associated to FORMULA , and
FORMULA 
is the strict
transform function.
Notation 7.2 
For FORMULA :

Let FORMULA ,
be the unique compact edge of the local Newton polygon of FORMULA  (see (REF ) at level FORMULA ).

Let FORMULA  the Newton diagram of FORMULA .
We denote by FORMULA  the set FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be the edge of
FORMULA  which is the intersection of FORMULA  with the vertical axis.

Let FORMULA  be defined by

Proposition 7.3 The following formula for the Milnor number of FORMULA  at the
origin is deduced in {{cite:6e83c113-4abc-491c-8f23-21498ffcb378}}.
FORMULA 

A set of polynomials defined from the embedded resolution
We associate in this section some polynomials to the elements in
FORMULA . From these polynomials we define a class of
deformations which we will study in the following sections.
Lemma 7.4 
If FORMULA  with FORMULA 
there exist FORMULA  and integers FORMULA  such that:

To avoid cumbersome notations we denote simply by FORMULA  the term
FORMULA , whenever FORMULA 
is clear form the context. For instance we have done this in
Formula (REF ) above. In particular, by (REF ) at
level FORMULA , the restriction of the function FORMULA  to FORMULA 
is equal to:
FORMULA 
Remark 7.5 
The integers FORMULA  depend on FORMULA  and on the
singular type of the branch FORMULA . They can be determined
algorithmically, and are unique up to certain conditions on the
polynomials FORMULA . The polynomials FORMULA  are
constructed as monomials in FORMULA  and some Weierstrass
polynomials defining curvettes at certain irreducible
exceptional divisors of the embedded resolution of FORMULA  (see
{{cite:6e83c113-4abc-491c-8f23-21498ffcb378}}). For more details on the construction of these
curves and their applications see {{cite:3a29ed22-4c19-4b65-8d99-bc95d139b4ae}}, {{cite:65ce98ce-198e-4f5d-8524-51c6b129e0e7}},

Multi-semi-quasi-homogeneous smoothings of a real plane
branch
In this Section we introduce a class of deformations of a plane
branch FORMULA , called multi-semi-quasi-homogeneous (msqh)
deformations and we describe their basic properties.
We suppose that FORMULA  is a plane branch defined by an equation,
FORMULA , such that its embedded resolution consists of FORMULA 
toric maps (see Section  and Notation
REF ). Consider the following algebraic expressions
in terms of the polynomials of Lemma REF  as a sequence of
deformations of the polynomial FORMULA  defining FORMULA . We
denote by FORMULA  the monomial FORMULA  and FORMULA  will
denote FORMULA  for any FORMULA .
FORMULA 
The terms FORMULA  are some real constants while the FORMULA 
are real parameters, for FORMULA . For technical reasons we
will suppose that FORMULA  for FORMULA  (we
need this assumption in Proposition REF  and
REF ). The choice of the notation FORMULA  in the deformation FORMULA  is related to the fact
that the terms FORMULA  appearing in the expansion of
FORMULA  are expressed in terms of the monomial FORMULA 
at the local coordinates of the level FORMULA  of the embedded
resolution of FORMULA , for FORMULA .
Notice that the polynomial FORMULA 
determines any of the terms FORMULA  for FORMULA , by
substituting
FORMULA  in FORMULA . Occasionally, we abuse of notation by denoting
FORMULA  by FORMULA .
Definition 8.1 A multi-semi-quasi-homogeneous (msqh) deformation of the
plane branch FORMULA  is a family FORMULA  defined by,
FORMULA  where FORMULA  is of the form (REF ), in a
Milnor ball of FORMULA . We say that FORMULA  is a
msqh-smoothing of FORMULA  if the curve FORMULA  is smooth and
transversal to the boundary of a Milnor ball for FORMULA .

Notation 8.2 We denote by FORMULA , or by FORMULA , the deformation
of FORMULA  defined by FORMULA  in a Milnor ball of FORMULA , for
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
We denote by FORMULA  the strict transform of
FORMULA  by the composition of toric maps FORMULA  and by FORMULA  (resp. by
FORMULA ) the polynomial defining
FORMULA  in the coordinates FORMULA  (resp. FORMULA ), for FORMULA .

These notations are analogous to those used for FORMULA  in Section
, see (REF ). In particular, we have
that the result of substituting in FORMULA ,
the term FORMULA , by using Formula (REF ) at level FORMULA , is
FORMULA .
Proposition 8.3  ({{cite:6e83c113-4abc-491c-8f23-21498ffcb378}})

If FORMULA  the curves FORMULA 
and FORMULA  meet the exceptional divisor of FORMULA  only at the point FORMULA  and with the
same intersection multiplicity FORMULA .

If FORMULA  the curves FORMULA  meet
the exceptional divisor of FORMULA 
only at FORMULA  points of FORMULA , counted with multiplicity.


Remark 8.4  ({{cite:6e83c113-4abc-491c-8f23-21498ffcb378}})

If FORMULA  the local Newton polygon of
FORMULA  and of FORMULA 
coincide.

If FORMULA  then FORMULA  is a face of the
Newton polygons of FORMULA  and of
FORMULA  corresponding to those terms which
are not divisible by FORMULA  (see Notations REF ).


Proposition 8.5  (see {{cite:6e83c113-4abc-491c-8f23-21498ffcb378}})
If FORMULA  then we have that:

The symbolic restriction of FORMULA  to the edge FORMULA  of its local Newton polygon is of
the form:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , for FORMULA .

The points of intersection of FORMULA  with
FORMULA  are those with coordinates FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 


Remark 8.6 
It follows from Proposition REF  that those
peripheral roots of FORMULA , which
are real,
are also positive for FORMULA .

When we say that FORMULA  defines a deformation with
parameter  FORMULA, we mean for FORMULA  fixed.
Proposition REF  motivates our choice of terminology in this
section.
Proposition 8.7  FORMULA  is a sqh-deformation with parameter FORMULA 
of the singularity FORMULA  for FORMULA .

Proof. By Proposition REF  the curves FORMULA  and FORMULA  intersect only the
irreducible component FORMULA  of the exceptional divisor of
FORMULA . By the construction of the
toric resolution this intersection is contained in the chart
FORMULA . By Lemma REF  and the
definitions in Formula (REF ), if FORMULA  is
defined on the chart FORMULA  by FORMULA  then FORMULA  is defined by:
FORMULA 
where for each FORMULA  the term FORMULA  denotes the term FORMULA  of (REF ). The elements FORMULA ,
expanded in terms of FORMULA , have constant term equal to one
by (REF ). It follows from this that the local Newton
polygon of FORMULA , with respect to the
variables FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , has only one compact face of
dimension two, which is equal to the graph of FORMULA  on the Newton
diagram FORMULA .
 FORMULA
Notice that the polynomial, FORMULA , defining the chart of the sqh-smoothing in Proposition
REF  does not depend on FORMULA  (see Notation
REF ).
We have that:

Proposition REF .
Definition 8.8 
The msqh-deformation FORMULA  is real non degenerated if
the polynomials FORMULA  in
(REF ) are real non degenerated with respect to the polygon
FORMULA , for FORMULA  (see Notations REF ).

Proposition 8.9  If the msqh-deformation FORMULA  is real non
degenerated then FORMULA  is a msqh-smoothing of the
singularity FORMULA . In particular, FORMULA  is a
msqh-smoothing of FORMULA .

Proof. We prove the Proposition by induction on FORMULA . If FORMULA  then the assertion is a consequence of Definition REF .
Suppose FORMULA , then by the induction hypothesis FORMULA 
is a msqh-smoothing of FORMULA . By Proposition
REF  the polynomial FORMULA , defining
the curve FORMULA , is non degenerated with respect to its
local Newton polygon. By Definition REF  the deformation
FORMULA  is a sqh-smoothing of FORMULA  with parameter
FORMULA . It follows that FORMULA  defines then a msqh-smoothing
of FORMULA  for FORMULA .  FORMULA
Gluing the charts of msqh-smoothings
In this Section we describe the patchwork of the charts of
FORMULA  and of
FORMULA  at the level FORMULA  of the toric resolution,
under some geometrical assumptions. We begin by some Lemmas for
sqh-smoothings.
Lemma 8.10 
Let us consider a semi-quasi-homogeneous smoothing FORMULA  defined
by FORMULA  of FORMULA  (see Notations REF ).
Set FORMULA  for the Newton polygon of FORMULA . Suppose that the
following statements hold:

The
chart FORMULA  is in maximal
position with respect to FORMULA .

The chart FORMULA  is in maximal position with respect to
FORMULA .

The order of the peripheral roots of FORMULA 
coincide when viewed in suitable arcs of the charts FORMULA  and FORMULA .

We label the peripheral roots FORMULA  of FORMULA  with the order induced by
the arcs the charts in (i) and (ii). We denote by
FORMULA  the arc of the chart in (k), for
FORMULA , which joins the peripheral roots FORMULA  and
FORMULA , for FORMULA . Then exactly one of this two
statements is verified:

In the patchwork of the
charts of FORMULA  and of FORMULA  the arcs
FORMULA  and FORMULA  glue into an oval intersecting FORMULA , for FORMULA .

In the gluing of the charts of FORMULA  and of FORMULA  the arcs FORMULA  and FORMULA 
glue into an oval intersecting FORMULA , for FORMULA .


Proof. If FORMULA  there is nothing to prove, hence we suppose
that FORMULA . By forgetting the relation FORMULA , we obtain two
symmetric copies of FORMULA  in FORMULA , by
the action of the symmetry FORMULA  (see notations of Section
). We denote by FORMULA  (resp. by
FORMULA ) the arc of chart in (k), for FORMULA , which intersects FORMULA 
at FORMULA  (resp. FORMULA  at FORMULA ).
By Theorem REF  if the arcs FORMULA 
and FORMULA  glue up in an oval intersecting
FORMULA  in the gluing of the charts of
FORMULA  and of FORMULA , then the
assertion of the Lemma holds for FORMULA , otherwise the
assertion of the Lemma holds for FORMULA .
 FORMULA
The dotted style curve in Figure REF  represents the two
possibilities for the chart of FORMULA  with good
oscillation. Cases (A) and (B) correspond to assertion (a) and (b)
respectively, where in this case FORMULA  is the symmetry
FORMULA .
FIGURE 
The following terminology is introduced,
with a slightly different meaning, in {{cite:1b397a8b-f942-4907-a924-b8ca9d4c0267}}:
Definition 8.11 
We say that the charts of FORMULA  and of FORMULA ,
associated with the sqh-smoothing FORMULA , have regular intersection
along FORMULA  if the statement (a) of Lemma
REF  hold.

Lemma 8.12 
Suppose that in the Lemma REF  statement
(a) holds. If in addition there exists (resp. there does not
exist) a connected component of the chart FORMULA  bounded by FORMULA  and FORMULA  then in
the gluing of the charts of FORMULA  and of
FORMULA  the arcs FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are contained (resp. are not
contained) in an oval
intersecting FORMULA .

Proof. Notice that by construction the arcs
FORMULA  glue with FORMULA 
(resp. for FORMULA  and
FORMULA ).
The arcs FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are in the same connected component of the chart FORMULA  since this chart is compact
and hence each connected component is an oval in particular the
one which is in maximal position with respect to
FORMULA .
The statement follows easily from these observations and the
hypothesis.  FORMULA
Figures REF  case (A) and REF 
represent the two possibilities indicated in Lemma
REF  when the chart FORMULA 
has good oscillation with respect to FORMULA .
FIGURE 
Denote by FORMULA  the Newton polygon of FORMULA . Notice that FORMULA  contains the Newton
polygon of FORMULA  and shares with it the common edge
FORMULA  by Remark REF  (i). We denote by
FORMULA  the Newton polygon of
FORMULA .
Proposition 8.13 
Let FORMULA  be a real non degenerated msqh-smoothing of
FORMULA . If the smoothing FORMULA  of FORMULA  is in maximal position (resp. has good oscillation) with
respect to the line FORMULA  then in a neighborhood of
FORMULA ,
the chart FORMULA  is in maximal position (resp. has good
oscillation) with respect to FORMULA .

Proof. By (REF ) we have that:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a monomial
in FORMULA  and FORMULA . Notice that FORMULA  is a polynomial of degree FORMULA  with non zero
constant term by Proposition REF  (ii). Denote by
FORMULA  the composition of the FORMULA 
transformation corresponding to (REF ) with the translation
induced by the exponent of the monomial FORMULA . Then we have that FORMULA  is an
isomorphism of triples
FORMULA 
In other terms FORMULA  induces an isomorphism of the toric
surfaces associated to these Newton polygons which maps the one
dimensional orbit associated to FORMULA  to the orbit
associated to FORMULA . More precisely, a point of the orbit of
FORMULA  is defined by the vanishing of FORMULA  for some FORMULA  and then by the
computations of Section  it corresponds to the
point of coordinates FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
identified with the orbit associated to FORMULA . This implies
that the following assertions are equivalent:

In a neighborhood of the line FORMULA ,
the chart FORMULA  is in maximal position
(resp. has good oscillation) with respect to the line
FORMULA .

In a neighborhood of the line,
FORMULA , the chart FORMULA  is in
maximal position (resp. has good oscillation) with respect to
FORMULA .

If the smoothing FORMULA  is in maximal position (resp.
has good oscillation) with respect to the line FORMULA  then there
is an arc of the smoothing FORMULA  which
contains the points FORMULA  and satisfies
the geometrical hypothesis with respect to the line FORMULA . By
Proposition REF  this arc does not intersect the
coordinate line corresponding to FORMULA  in the chart. This
implies that (a) holds and hence (b) holds.  FORMULA
Lemma 8.14 
Let FORMULA  be a real non degenerated msqh-smoothing of
FORMULA . Suppose that the charts FORMULA  and FORMULA  have regular
intersection along FORMULA  (see Definition REF ). If
the connected component of FORMULA  which meets
FORMULA  is an oval (resp. it is not an oval), then there are
precisely FORMULA  ovals (resp. FORMULA  ovals and one non
closed component) which intersect FORMULA  in the
Patchwork of the charts FORMULA  and of FORMULA , which describes the smoothing
FORMULA  of FORMULA . In addition, if the chart
FORMULA  has good oscillation) with respect to
FORMULA  and if FORMULA 
defines a Harnack curve in FORMULA , then the signed
topological type of the chart of FORMULA  is
unique.

Proof. Notice that by hypothesis and Proposition REF 
the smoothing FORMULA  is in maximal position with
respect to the line FORMULA . We have that the chart of FORMULA 
is in maximal position with respect to the line FORMULA .
We denote by FORMULA  the peripheral roots of
FORMULA , labelled with respect to the order in
the charts FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Then
there exist FORMULA  ovals meeting FORMULA  in the
patchwork of these charts by Lemma REF .
In addition, if the connected component of FORMULA 
which meets FORMULA  is an oval (resp. is not an oval), then the
hypothesis of Lemma REF  are satisfied
and the conclusion follows. For the second statement by
Proposition REF  we have that there are two
possible signed topological types for FORMULA  with prescribed
symbolic restriction to the face FORMULA . By Lemma
REF  only one of these two types induces
regular intersection along the edge FORMULA .  FORMULA
We call the ovals described by Lemma REF  mixed ovals of
depth 1. We call ovals of depth 1, those which appear
in the chart of FORMULA  (see (REF ))
but do not cut FORMULA . In Figure REF  we represent
a mixed oval of depth one; the ball FORMULA  is a Milnor ball for
FORMULA , the segment of the oval in small ball FORMULA 
corresponds to an arc of the chart of FORMULA ,
while the segment of the oval in FORMULA  corresponds to
an arc of the chart FORMULA .
FIGURE 
Definition 8.15  Let FORMULA  be a msqh-smoothing of
FORMULA . An oval FORMULA  of FORMULA  is of depth FORMULA  (resp. a
mixed oval of depth FORMULA ) if there exists an oval FORMULA  of depth
1 (resp. a mixed oval of depth 1) of the smoothing
FORMULA  of FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and such that FORMULA  arises as a slight perturbation of
the oval FORMULA  of
FORMULA , for FORMULA .


Maximal, Harnack and multi-Harnack smoothings
We introduce the following notions for a real non degenerated
msqh-smoothing FORMULA  of a real plane branch FORMULA . By
Proposition REF  if FORMULA  is a non degenerated
msqh-smoothing of FORMULA  then FORMULA  is also a non
degenerated msqh-smoothing of FORMULA , for FORMULA .
Definition 8.16

FORMULA  is a FORMULA -smoothing if the number
of ovals in a Milnor ball of FORMULA  is equal to FORMULA .

A FORMULA -smoothing FORMULA  is Harnack if it
has good oscillation with respect to the coordinate axis.

A FORMULA -smoothing FORMULA  is multi-Harnack if
FORMULA  is a Harnack FORMULA -msqh-smoothing of FORMULA , for FORMULA .


In Definition REF  (iii) the Harnack condition is
considered with respect to the coordinate lines defined by the
coordinates FORMULA , see Section  for notations.
The following result describes inductively FORMULA -msqh-smoothings and
Harnack msqh-smoothings of FORMULA  when FORMULA .
Theorem 8.1  Let FORMULA  be a non
degenerated msqh-smoothing of the real plane branch FORMULA . We
introduce the following conditions:

FORMULA  is a FORMULA -msqh-smoothing of FORMULA  in maximal position with respect to the exceptional divisor
FORMULA .

FORMULA  defines a FORMULA -sqh-smoothing of the
singularity FORMULA  with parameter FORMULA .

The charts of FORMULA  and of
FORMULA  have regular intersection along FORMULA .

Then, the deformation FORMULA  is a FORMULA  (resp Harnack)
msqh-smoothing of FORMULA  if and only if conditions (i),
(ii) and (iii) hold (resp. and in addition FORMULA  has
good oscillation with respect to the coordinate axis).

Proof. We prove first that if conditions (i) and (ii) hold then FORMULA  is a FORMULA -msqh-smoothing of FORMULA .
The number of ovals of the msqh-smoothing FORMULA  is
equal to
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is in maximal position with respect to
FORMULA  there is only one connected component FORMULA  of the smoothing
FORMULA  which intersect FORMULA  in FORMULA  different real
points. When we apply the toric morphism FORMULA  we get a
deformation FORMULA  of FORMULA , defined by FORMULA . Notice that FORMULA  is singular at 0. By
Proposition REF  the singularity FORMULA  is real non degenerated with respect its local Newton
polygon. The image FORMULA  by FORMULA  of the component FORMULA  passes
through the origin and is the only connected component of FORMULA  with this property. The deformation FORMULA  has
the same number of ovals as FORMULA , which are of depth
FORMULA .
By hypothesis (ii) we
have that FORMULA  is a FORMULA -sqh-smoothing of FORMULA  with
parameter FORMULA  hence it yields FORMULA  ovals of depth 1. By Proposition REF  the chart
of FORMULA  with respect to its Newton polygon
FORMULA , is in maximal position with respect to
FORMULA . By hypothesis (iii) we are in the situation
described by Lemma REF : if FORMULA  is an oval (resp. is not) the
image of FORMULA  in the chart of FORMULA  patchwork with the
chart FORMULA 
providing FORMULA  mixed ovals of depth 1 (resp. FORMULA  mixed
ovals of depth 1). It follows that the msqh-smoothing
FORMULA  has the maximal number of ovals (see
(REF )).
Conversely, suppose that FORMULA  is a msqh-smoothing. Since
FORMULA  defines a sqh-smoothing of FORMULA  with
parameter FORMULA , there are at most FORMULA  ovals of depth 1.
If there are FORMULA  components of the smoothing FORMULA 
which intersect FORMULA  then
we prove that the maximal number of ovals of the smoothing FORMULA is bounded below by:
FORMULA 
If no component of the smoothing FORMULA  intersects
FORMULA  then there is no mixed oval of depth 1 for the smoothing
FORMULA  and therefore FORMULA  is not a
FORMULA -msqh-smoothing by (REF ). Therefore there exist
FORMULA  components of the smoothing FORMULA , each one
cutting FORMULA  in FORMULA  real points. We argue as in Lemma
REF : if such a component
is not an oval
then it leads to FORMULA  mixed ovals;
if this component is an oval then it contributes with
FORMULA  mixed ovals, but we also loose one oval of depth 2. It
follows that if FORMULA  is a FORMULA -msqh-smoothing then FORMULA 
and FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA  is in maximal position
with respect to the line FORMULA  and assertion (iii) hold.  FORMULA
Corollary 8.2 
Let FORMULA  be a real non degenerated msqh-smoothing of the
real plane branch FORMULA . We introduce the following conditions:

FORMULA  is a multi-Harnack smoothing of
FORMULA .

FORMULA  defines FORMULA -sqh-smoothing of the
singularity FORMULA  with parameter FORMULA , in maximal
position with respect to the coordinate axis.

The charts of FORMULA  and of
FORMULA  have regular intersection along FORMULA .

Then the deformation FORMULA  is a multi-Harnack smoothing of
FORMULA  if and only if conditions (i), (ii) and (iii)
hold.

Proof. It follows by induction on FORMULA  from Theorem
REF  and Theorem REF .  FORMULA

Existence of multi-Harnack smoothings
In this section we prove the existence of a multi-Harnack
smoothing of a real plane branch FORMULA . We will use the
following observation of Viro.
Remark 8.17  (see {{cite:b6d82989-4cf9-4590-9748-b32b4d96d51f}} page 19) If FORMULA  is
defined by a non degenerated semi-quasi-homogeneous polynomial
then any smoothing of FORMULA  constructed by patchworking is topologically equivalent, in a stratified sense with respect to
the boundary of a Milnor ball and the coordinate axis, to a
sqh-smoothing.

Theorem 8.3 Any real plane branch FORMULA  has a multi-Harnack smoothing.

Proof. We construct a multi-Harnack smoothing FORMULA  of
FORMULA  by induction on FORMULA . If FORMULA  by Proposition
REF  there exists a Harnack smoothing of FORMULA  and
by Remark REF  we construct from this a topologically
equivalent sqh-smoothing, which is also Harnack. Suppose the
result true for FORMULA . Then by induction hypothesis we have
constructed a multi-Harnack smoothing FORMULA  of
FORMULA . By Proposition REF  the deformation
FORMULA  is defined by a sqh-polynomial FORMULA  with
peripheral roots of the same sign by Remark REF . Then
we can apply Proposition REF  and Remark REF  to
construct Harnack sqh-smoothings FORMULA  of the singularity
FORMULA  with parameter FORMULA , such that the charts of
FORMULA  and of FORMULA  have regular
intersection along FORMULA , by Lemma
REF . The result follows by Corollary
REF .  FORMULA

The topological type of a multi-Harnack smoothing
The definition of the topological type (resp. signed topological
type) of a msqh-smoothing FORMULA  of a real plane branch is
the same as in the 1-parametrical case (see Definition
REF ).
Theorem 8.4 
Let FORMULA  be a real branch. The topological type of
multi-Harnack smoothings of FORMULA  is unique. There is at most
two signed topological types of multi-Harnack smoothings of FORMULA . These types depend only on the complex equisingularity class
of FORMULA .

Proof. We prove the result by induction on FORMULA . For FORMULA 
there is a unique topological type of Harnack smoothing and two
signed topological types by Theorem REF . Suppose FORMULA . We consider a multi-Harnack smoothing FORMULA  of FORMULA .
It is easy to see by Corollary REF  and induction that
FORMULA  defines a sqh-Harnack smoothing of FORMULA . By construction the singularity FORMULA  is
non degenerated with respect to its Newton polygon in the
coordinates FORMULA . Since the smoothing
FORMULA  is Harnack then there is only one topological
type and two signed topological types (see Proposition
REF ). We prove that there are at most two
signed topological types (resp. exactly one topological type) of
multi-Harnack smoothings, each one determined by the
equisingularity class of FORMULA  and an initial choice for the
sign type of the Harnack smoothing FORMULA : to be
normalized or not.
By induction on FORMULA  we assume that the topological type (resp.
the signed topological type) of the msqh-smoothing FORMULA  of FORMULA  depends only on the
characteristic pairs of FORMULA  with respect to the
coordinates FORMULA . Hence it is determined by the complex
equisingularity class of FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is an isomorphism
over FORMULA  we deduce that the topological type
(resp. the signed topological type) of the msqh-deformation
FORMULA  is determined inside a Milnor ball FORMULA  of FORMULA , for
FORMULA . Notice that FORMULA  is a
singular curve with FORMULA  branches at the origin. Let FORMULA  be a Milnor ball for the singularity FORMULA . The
radius of FORMULA  depends on FORMULA  and FORMULA  is contained in the
interior of FORMULA . By construction the msqh-smoothing FORMULA  is
built by the patchwork of the charts of FORMULA 
and of FORMULA  described in Section REF . By induction
hypothesis the topological type (resp. the signed topological
type) of FORMULA  is fixed in FORMULA . We can
assume that the embedded topology of the chart
FORMULA  is
determined. By Corollary REF  it is enough to prove that
there is a unique (resp. signed) topological way to patchwork the
chart of FORMULA , in such a way that FORMULA 
defines a multi-Harnack smoothing.
Corollary REF  (ii) together with Theorem REF 
implies that FORMULA  defines a Harnack curve in
the toric surface FORMULA . By Proposition
REF  there are two possible signed topological
types for the chart of FORMULA  (which are
related by the symmetry FORMULA ). By Corollary
REF  the charts of FORMULA  and of
FORMULA  have regular intersection along the edge
FORMULA . By Lemma REF  this condition
holds for only one of the two possible signed types of Harnack
curves FORMULA .
The signed topological type of
the chart of FORMULA  is uniquely determined and
it depends only on FORMULA . By the induction hypothesis the
topological type of FORMULA  is fixed in FORMULA  hence there is a unique topological type and at most two
signed topological of multi-Harnack smoothings of the real plane
branch FORMULA . The topological type only depend on the sequence
of triangles FORMULA , hence on the equisingularity class of the
branch.  FORMULA

Positions and scales of the ovals of multi-Harnack
smoothings
We deduce some consequences on the position in the quadrants of
FORMULA  and on the scales of the ovals of a msqh-smoothing , in
particular in the multi-Harnack case.
Multi-scaled structure of msqh-smoothings
Let FORMULA  be a msqh-smoothing of a real plane branch
FORMULA . Recall that the notion of oval of depth FORMULA  of
FORMULA  was introduced in Definition REF .
Proposition 8.18 
The size of an oval FORMULA  of depth FORMULA  in a msqh-smoothing
FORMULA  is equal to FORMULA .

Proof. By Proposition REF  the size of the oval
FORMULA  in the coordinates FORMULA  is equal to FORMULA . The image of FORMULA  by FORMULA , described by
(REF ), is an oval of FORMULA  of size FORMULA  since the function
FORMULA  on the oval by (REF ). By definition the oval
FORMULA  is not contained in the connected component of FORMULA  which passes by FORMULA . By Proposition
REF  and Theorem REF  the smoothing
FORMULA  of the singularity FORMULA  only performs small perturbations of the ovals of
FORMULA  and hence the size of corresponding ovals with
respect to the coordinates FORMULA  is the same.
It follows that FORMULA  is slightly deformed into an oval
FORMULA  of FORMULA  such that FORMULA . By induction we find that the oval FORMULA  is
of size
FORMULA 
Proposition 8.19 
If FORMULA  is a msqh-smoothing of the real plane branch
FORMULA  then any pair of ovals of depth FORMULA  with FORMULA  is
not nested.

Proof. By the Definition REF  it is enough to prove
it when FORMULA . Let FORMULA  denote a Milnor ball for the singularity
FORMULA  and FORMULA  a Milnor ball for the non
degenerated singularity FORMULA . The ball FORMULA  is
contained in the interior of FORMULA  and the radius of FORMULA  depends on
the parameters. Notice that by Theorem REF  the smoothing
FORMULA  of the singularity FORMULA  is constructed
by the patchwork of the charts of FORMULA  and of
FORMULA . We have that topologically in a stratified sense with
respect to the coordinate axis and the boundary of FORMULA , we
replace the pair FORMULA  by
FORMULA , by
identifying FORMULA  with FORMULA , while in FORMULA  the curves FORMULA  and FORMULA  remain isotopic. This implies that
in FORMULA  the curve FORMULA  contains arcs of
the mixed ovals of depth 1 and ovals of depth FORMULA .  FORMULA
Remark 8.20 A msqh-smoothing of the real plane branch may have nested ovals
(see Example REF ).


The multi-Harnack case
Let FORMULA  be a multi-Harnack smoothing of the real plane
branch FORMULA . By the proof of Theorem REF , the ovals
of FORMULA  do not cut FORMULA  for FORMULA . It
follows that each oval of FORMULA  is either an oval
(resp. a mixed oval) of depth FORMULA  for some FORMULA . There are
precisely FORMULA  mixed ovals of depth FORMULA  and FORMULA  ovals of depth FORMULA . The ovals of a multi-Harnack
smoothing are not nested by Proposition REF , Theorem
REF  and Proposition REF . We complement the
information on the size of ovals of Section REF  by
indicating the form of the boxes which contain the mixed ovals of
depth FORMULA . The proof is analogous to that of Proposition
REF  which indicates the size of ovals of depth FORMULA  (see
Figure REF ).
Proposition 8.21 
A mixed oval of depth FORMULA  of the multi-Harnack smoothing
FORMULA  of FORMULA  is contained in a box parallel to the
coordinate axis and with two vertices of the form
FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
for FORMULA .

FIGURE 
Now we describe the positions of the ovals in the quadrants of
FORMULA  of a multi-Harnack smoothing FORMULA  of a real plane
branch FORMULA .
Definition 8.22 We say that the signed topological type of a multi-Harnack
smoothing FORMULA  of a real plane branch FORMULA  is normalized
if the signed topological type of the chart of
FORMULA  is normalized (see Definition
REF ).

Proposition 8.23 
Let FORMULA  be a multi-Harnack smoothing of a real plane
branch FORMULA . If the signed topological type of the chart of
FORMULA  is normalized, then the same happens for the signed
topological type of the chart FORMULA , for FORMULA .

Proof. The proof is by induction on FORMULA , using Proposition
REF  and that FORMULA .
 FORMULA
We assume that the signed type of the smoothing is normalized. By
the proof of Theorem REF  and the definition an oval of
depth FORMULA  of FORMULA  arises as a connected component
FORMULA  of the chart FORMULA , for FORMULA  (see Remark REF ). An arc of a mixed oval
of depth FORMULA  corresponds to a connected component
FORMULA  of the chart FORMULA , for FORMULA .
Since at each stage the smoothing FORMULA  of FORMULA 
is multi-Harnack only the non compact component of the smoothing
FORMULA  meets the coordinate axis. Then we have the
following:
Proposition 8.24 If FORMULA  is a normalized multi-Harnack smoothing of a real
plane branch FORMULA  then we can label the ovals of depth FORMULA 
(resp. the mixed ovals of depth FORMULA ) by FORMULA  for
FORMULA  (resp. for FORMULA ). Then we have that FORMULA  where
FORMULA 

Proof. By hypothesis and Proposition REF 
we have that the signed topological type of the chart of
FORMULA  is normalized, for FORMULA . By
Remark REF  we have that the component
FORMULA  of the chart FORMULA  is contained in the quadrant
FORMULA  with respect to the coordinates FORMULA . We abuse of notation and denote in the same way the
component FORMULA  of the chart FORMULA  and the corresponding connected
component of the smoothing FORMULA . By
construction the oval FORMULA , which appears as a slight
deformation of FORMULA  of FORMULA , is contained in the same quadrant FORMULA  as FORMULA .
Notice that on the oval FORMULA  the function FORMULA , for FORMULA  by (REF ), for FORMULA .
Then the assertion follows by the definition of the toric maps
FORMULA  in (REF ).  FORMULA

Examples
Example 8.25 We consider first the constructions of a multi-Harnack smoothing
of the real plane branch FORMULA  defined by the polynomial FORMULA  studied in the Example REF  and
REF . The Milnor number is equal to 44.

The strict transform FORMULA  of FORMULA  is a simple cusp. Then a
smoothing FORMULA  of normalized type is of the form
indicated in Figure REF . We indicate the form of the
deformation FORMULA  inside a Milnor ball FORMULA  for FORMULA  in
Figure REF ; the small circle denotes a Milnor ball
FORMULA  for the singularity obtained. The smoothing FORMULA  is
the result of perturbing this singularity inside its Milnor ball
and appears in Figure REF . Notice that the ovals
which appear in the smaller ball are infinitesimally smaller than
the others. In this example there is only one oval of depth 2
and two mixed ovals of depth 1.
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
Example 8.26 We consider first the constructions of multi-Harnack smoothings of the real plane branch FORMULA 
defined by the polynomial FORMULA . The Milnor number is equal to 86.

By computing as in Section  we find that FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA . It follows
that the strict transform FORMULA  of FORMULA  has local Newton
polygon with vertices FORMULA  and FORMULA . Figure
REF  shows the signed topological types of a Harnack
smoothing FORMULA  of FORMULA . Then, the
deformation FORMULA , obtained by Proposition REF  is
shown in Figure REF  (A) and (B) (notice that all the
branches of the singularity at the origin have the same tangent
line, the horizontal axis, though this is not represented in the
Figure).
Then, if FORMULA  defines a multi-Harnack smoothing of FORMULA 
we have that FORMULA  has the chart
represented in Figure REF . The topology of the
multi-Harnack smoothing is shown in Figure REF .
Notice that, as stated in Theorem REF , the topological
type of the resulting msqh-smoothing FORMULA  is the same in
cases (A) and (B) (meanwhile the signed topological types are
different). The ovals inside the fist ball are of depth 1, those
intersecting the boundary are mixed ovals of depth 1 and the
ovals in between both balls are of depth 2.
Example 8.27 
We show a Harnack smoothing of the real plane branch FORMULA 
defined by the polynomial FORMULA  which is not
multi-Harnack.

By computing as in Section  we find that FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  and FORMULA . It
follows that the strict transform FORMULA  of FORMULA  has
local Newton polygon with vertices FORMULA  and FORMULA .
We exhibit first a smoothing FORMULA , defined by a
degree seven curve with Newton polygon equal to FORMULA . The
construction begins
by perturbing a degree four
curve, composed of a smooth conic FORMULA  and two lines FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in Figure REF  (a), with four lines, shown in grey,
intersecting the conic in two real points (see {{cite:623e458e-b347-4c18-892c-8f998833b03d}} for a
summary of construction of real curves by small perturbations).
The result is a smooth quartic FORMULA , as in Figure REF 
(b), where we have indicated in gray the reference lines FORMULA  and
FORMULA  with the conic FORMULA . Then we perturb the union of FORMULA  and
FORMULA , by taking six lines, as in Figure REF  (c). The
result is a FORMULA -sextic in maximal position with respect to the
line FORMULA . The union of both curves is a degree seven curve FORMULA ,
as shown
in Figure REF (d),
where we indicate also the reference lines FORMULA  and FORMULA . Notice
that
in Figures REF  (c) and (d).
the line at infinity changes. See also the construction of curves
corresponding to Figure 13 and 14 of {{cite:623e458e-b347-4c18-892c-8f998833b03d}}. The result of a
suitable perturbation of the singularities of FORMULA  is the
FORMULA -degree seven curve shown in Figure REF  (e). Notice
that this curve, which we call also FORMULA , is in maximal position
with respect to the line FORMULA  and has maximal intersection
multiplicity with the line FORMULA  at the point FORMULA . It
follows that a polynomial defining FORMULA , with respect to affine
coordinates FORMULA  such that FORMULA  defines the line FORMULA , FORMULA 
defines FORMULA  and FORMULA  is the line at infinity, has generically
Newton polygon with vertices FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , since
FORMULA  passes by the point FORMULA . The chart of FORMULA , with
respect to its Newton polygon, is shown in Figure REF 
(f).
We construct from the curve FORMULA  a sqh-smoothing FORMULA  of FORMULA . By Proposition REF  the
topology of the deformation FORMULA  can be seen from the
chart associated to FORMULA  (compare Figures REF  (f)
and REF  (g), where we have indicated by the
same number the corresponding peripheral roots)
We define then a msqh-Harnack smoothing FORMULA  of FORMULA 
by gluing together the chart of FORMULA  with the chart of a
suitable Harnack smoothing of FORMULA  (see Theorem
REF ) . The topology of the msqh-Harnack smoothing
FORMULA  is shown in Figure REF  (h).
