Using a reformulation of the nonlinear multiplet as a gauge
multiplet, we discuss its dynamics. We show that the nonlinear
“duality” that appears to relate the model to a conventional
FORMULA -model introduces a new sector into the theory.


Introduction
Conformal field theories provide string backgrounds. Different
supermultiplets in general give rise to different superconformal field
theories. The nonlinear multiplet was first introduced as a
compensating multiplet for FORMULA  FORMULA  supergravity {{cite:968954c1-d291-43c0-a91b-cad764e0497c}}. It
was later used to construct hyperkähler metrics {{cite:a6dcbe6c-cdac-4227-8336-4c4f49720906}}. In this
letter we study it as a FORMULA  dynamical system in its own right. We
find a number of novel features: It can be formulated as a theory
with a sector linear in a gauge field analogous to a FORMULA 
topological theory {{cite:c5d95b12-27df-419e-a9e9-ab1e106b4451}}, {{cite:a5824cc4-9f3a-4b2a-aca8-aff53f234ffc}}. It is “dual” to an ordinary
FORMULA -model via a nonlinear “duality” that introduces new
solutions to the classical field equations (and presumably new states
in the quantum theory).
We begin this letter with a quick review of the nonlinear multiplet
and FORMULA  superspace. We then reformulate the nonlinear multiplet as
a kind of FORMULA  gauge multiplet, and give a construction of a
nontrivial string theory background (a hyperkähler manifold). Next
we define gauge-covariant components and give the component
action. Finally, we discuss the nonlinear “duality”.


Review of the nonlinear multiplet
We begin with a quick review of higher FORMULA  superspaces in two
dimensions. Dimensional analysis of the
superspace measure and the superfield component content implies that to
construct superspace actions one needs to find invariant subspaces and
corresponding restricted measures. Such subspaces are analogous to
FORMULA , FORMULA  chiral and antichiral superspaces. To this end, in a
series of papers {{cite:b048f573-5209-4f3d-91f4-e13223b81ac2}}, {{cite:ff411714-8141-4dda-b7f7-c953ae50ad4c}}, {{cite:1c84926d-4de1-4a29-888e-292d605e7274}}, {{cite:1d365c6b-524e-439a-a200-8c63bb90cc30}}, we have constructed and
used a projective superspace. In the present FORMULA  context, it is
introduced as follows {{cite:a6dcbe6c-cdac-4227-8336-4c4f49720906}}, {{cite:ff411714-8141-4dda-b7f7-c953ae50ad4c}} (see also {{cite:b048f573-5209-4f3d-91f4-e13223b81ac2}}, {{cite:1c84926d-4de1-4a29-888e-292d605e7274}}): The
complex FORMULA  doublet spinor derivatives FORMULA , FORMULA 
that describe FORMULA  supersymmetry obey the commutation relations
FORMULA 
(all others vanish). When we work with FORMULA  superfields, we
identify FORMULA  as the FORMULA  spinor covariant
derivative and FORMULA  as the generator of the
nonmanifest supersymmetries. We use a complex variable FORMULA  to
define a set of anticommuting spinor derivativesIn
{{cite:a6dcbe6c-cdac-4227-8336-4c4f49720906}}, {{cite:ff411714-8141-4dda-b7f7-c953ae50ad4c}}, FORMULA  are rescaled by a factor:
FORMULA .:
FORMULA 
A real structure FORMULA  acts on FORMULA  by hermitian
conjugation composed with the antipodal map, i.e.;
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA , the map FORMULA  preserves the
subspaces annihilated by the derivatives (REF ). To describe the
nonlinear multiplet {{cite:968954c1-d291-43c0-a91b-cad764e0497c}}, {{cite:a6dcbe6c-cdac-4227-8336-4c4f49720906}}, we consider a superfield
FORMULA , with particular FORMULA  dependence and a reality condition:
FORMULA 
The reality condition implies that the FORMULA  superfields FORMULA 
obey
FORMULA 
which we solve by writing
FORMULA 
Finally, we require that FORMULA  is
annihilated by the derivatives in (REF ); these FORMULA 
constraints lead to the FORMULA  component relations
FORMULA 
which imply
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
To construct FORMULA  actions for FORMULA  superfields we use a second set of
linearily independent covariant spinor derivatives:
FORMULA 
An action may then be written as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is an appropriate contour. Using
FORMULA 
and (of course) FORMULA , the FORMULA  superspace
form of the
action (REF ) is:
FORMULA 
Up to a sign (FORMULA ) and the relabelling
(FORMULA , FORMULA ), this is the description of
the nonlinear multiplet given in {{cite:a6dcbe6c-cdac-4227-8336-4c4f49720906}}.
We may also consider an FORMULA  nonlinear multiplet that obeys only the
constraint (REF ) and
FORMULA 
and has an action
FORMULA 
for arbitrary FORMULA . Clearly, the FORMULA  symmetric action (REF )
is a special case of this, and our subsequent discussion applies to
the general case (REF ).
We do not know how to solve the constraints
(REF ) and (REF ) in superspace (Actually, not even in
FORMULA  superspace!). Consequently, it is not clear what the superfield
equations are, and in {{cite:a6dcbe6c-cdac-4227-8336-4c4f49720906}} we did not look directly at the
dynamics of the nonlinear multiplet. To do so, we would have needed to
go to components, and the component expansion of the action
(REF ) subject to the constraints (REF ), (REF )
is very tedious. In the next section, we reformulate the nonlinear
multiplet in a way that makes the computation of the component action
tractable.
In {{cite:a6dcbe6c-cdac-4227-8336-4c4f49720906}}, we studied the action in another way: We found a
“duality” transformation to a formulation in terms of ordinary
FORMULA  chiral superfields; in terms of these, the dynamics can be
understood straightforwardly. The “duality” transformation
resembles the well known target space duality of string theory, but
is nonlinear. It is performed as follows: we replace the action by a
first-order action
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is now an unconstrained superfield, and FORMULA  is a
chiral superfield: FORMULA . Integrating out FORMULA , we
recover the constraint (REF ); integrating out FORMULA  gives
FORMULA , and substituting back gives a
standard FORMULA  action for the chiral superfields FORMULA .
However, as noted in {{cite:a6dcbe6c-cdac-4227-8336-4c4f49720906}}, this is a peculiar “duality”: the
trivial action FORMULA  gives rise to a nontrivial free action
for FORMULA . We resolve this paradox in the section 4.


The nonlinear multiplet as a gauge multiplet.
As discussed in the introduction, the formalism can be simplified by
rewriting the nonlinear multiplet as a gauge multiplet. We do this
by rescaling
FORMULA 
Then the superfield FORMULA  becomes
FORMULA 
and the constraints and transformations (REF ) become
(suppressing the FORMULA  indices on the spinor operators FORMULA ):

FORMULA 
a ,    
a
FORMULA Q(e-iYa)=-abaDb .
The superfield FORMULA  is left unchanged by a gauge transformation:
FORMULA 
Because of this invariance, the transformations (REF ) do not
determine the transformations of the fields FORMULA ; We can
consistently choose:
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
(Note that (REF ) breaks the manifest FORMULA  invariance
of (REF ) to an FORMULA  subgroup.) The transformations and
constraints (REF ), (REF ) are invariant under
the gauge transformations (REF ) as long as FORMULA  is
chiral: FORMULA . In this case, FORMULA  transforms as an
ordinary FORMULA  FORMULA  gauge supermultiplet. This allows us to find
component actions in a Wess-Zumino gauge, greatly simplifying our
calculations.
We work in a chiral representation of the gauge group, and define
FORMULA 
We also define gauge covariant derivatives  FORMULA
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the charge of the field that FORMULA  acts on (FORMULA  and
FORMULA  both have FORMULA ). These derivatives obey the usual algebra
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  is the superfield strength of FORMULA , and is a
twisted chiral superfield with charge FORMULA : FORMULA .
The FORMULA  action (REF ) becomes:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is restricted to be gauge invariantActually, gauge
invariance of the action implies invariance of FORMULA  only up to
superspace total derivatives; this has no effect on our analysis.:
FORMULA 
and where FORMULA  and FORMULA . We use (REF ) and its derivatives frequently
below. The condition that the action (REF ) has FORMULA 
supersymmetry is Laplace's equation
FORMULA 
The constraint (REF ) (and its complex conjugate) become
simply
FORMULA 
These constraints are
actually gauge covariant; thus when we go to first order form
and impose them via chiral Lagrange multipliers FORMULA  and
FORMULA  (recall that we are replacing
FORMULA  with the unconstrained gauge superfield FORMULA ), the action
(REF ) is gauge invariant if FORMULA  both have charge
FORMULA :
FORMULA 
The gauge invariance of the action allows us to choose a gauge that
is very convenient for performing the “duality” transformation:
FORMULA . In this gauge, we may for example consider FORMULA ; this gives
FORMULA 
(Equivalently, we may choose as the action a Fayet-Iliopoulos term for
FORMULA .) Eliminating FORMULA  by the equation FORMULA , we get the Kähler potential for the Eguchi-Hansen
gravitational instanton with the “wrong” sign of the mass-parameter.
This gives a nontrivial example of a hyperkähler metric constructed
using the nonlinear multiplet and “duality” transformation.


Components
In this section, we descend from superspace to spacetime, and
compute the component action. We work with the first order
system (REF ), and derive the component form of the
constraints by integrating out the component Lagrange multiplier
fields. After giving the full action in a compact geometric
formulation, we focus on the bosonic sector and resolve the paradox
that our nonlinear “duality” introduced.
As usual, we define component fields as FORMULA  independent
projections of the superfields and their spinor derivatives. The
Wess-Zumino gauge components of the gauge superfield are:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the component gauge field, and FORMULA , etc., are
various gauge invariant superpartners of FORMULA .
The components of the chiral superfields FORMULA 
(recall that FORMULA  is the Lagrange multiplier field) are:
FORMULA 
We denote the set FORMULA  collectively by FORMULA  (similarly, we
denote FORMULA , etc.), and the total super-Lagrangian
FORMULA  by the
Kähler potential FORMULA .
The component Lagrangain, after integrating by parts and eliminating
the auxiliary fields FORMULA  to bring out the geometric features, is:
FORMULA 
where the metric FORMULA , the
Levi-Civita connection FORMULA , and the curvature FORMULA  of the Kähler manifold with potential FORMULA  are
FORMULA 
(for Kähler manifolds, these and their complex conjugates are the
only nonvanishing components). Further, FORMULA  is the killing vector
FORMULA , FORMULA , and the
world-sheet covariant derivatives
FORMULA 
are both gauge and diffeomorphism covariant. In deriving the
Lagrangian FORMULA  (REF ), we have used the following identities:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the charge of FORMULA . To get the pure
nonlinear multiplet action, we separate out the dependence on the
Lagrange-multiplier multiplet
FORMULA , and integrate it out. This gives the constraints:
FORMULA 
Aa+(i 2DI -ww)Aa
--+a ++-a)=0 ,
and their complex conjugates.
The basic features of the model can be seen in the bosonic
sector of the Lagrangian (REF ); after integrating by parts
and collecting terms, we find
FORMULA 
Aa) ) -i 2(C- C)(DI |A|2-i 2Aa

FORMULA

Substituting back into FORMULA  (REF ), we find
FORMULA 
4|A|2 +1 2(++Aa=Ab+=Aa++Ab)) -18(Aa La-AaLa)Ac
 FORMULAAc|A|2 .                              
This still depends on the gauge field FORMULA ; however, the dependence is
now only linear, and hence FORMULA  cannot be integrated out. Thus
we appear to have found a “duality” between a conventional
FORMULA -model and a model with a sector that is first order in
derivatives. The most extreme form of this paradox occurs when the
superspace lagrangian FORMULA  (REF ) vanishes: then
FORMULA , but its “dual” is FORMULA AaFORMULA wFORMULA wFORMULA LboseFORMULA w=0FORMULA C+C=LabAaAb|A|2FORMULA w=0 FORMULAFORMULA C+C=LabAaAb|A|2FORMULA LnonlinFORMULA Lbose FORMULA FORMULA


Conclusions
We have reformulated the nonlinear multiplet as a gauge multiplet.
This allowed us to compute the component Lagrangian in a Wess-Zumino
gauge. We found a system with a subsystem linear in the gauge field
(REF ). We considered a nonlinear “duality” transformation
that eliminates this unusual subsystem and gives an ordinary
FORMULA -model. We found that the two theories are not dual in the
sense of representing different formulations of the same theory, but
correspond to different sectors of the first order model
(REF ).
Our analysis has been entirely classical; it would be interesting to
study the nonlinear multiplet at the quantum level. In particular,
one would like to see if the nonlinear “dual” of a superconformal
field theory is superconformal, and if it is, what, if any, relation
the two theories have. A second unsolved problem is classical and
more geometric: which FORMULA -models admit a nonlinear “duality”
to a nonlinear multiplet formulation.
