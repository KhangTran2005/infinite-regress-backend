We show that the Calabi homomorphism extends to some groups of homeomorphisms on exact symplectic manifolds.
The proof is based on the uniqueness of the generating Hamiltonian (proved by Viterbo) of continuous Hamiltonian
isotopies (introduced by Müller and Oh).
Introduction
The Calabi homomorphism
Let FORMULA  be a symplectic manifold, supposed to be exact, that is FORMULA  for some 1-form
FORMULA  called Liouville form. Equivalently, this also means that there exists a vector field FORMULA  such that
the Lie derivative satisfies: FORMULA . The vector field FORMULA  is called the Liouville vector
field and is related to the 1-form FORMULA  by the relation FORMULA . For instance, cotangent bundles
are exact symplectic manifolds.
Thanks to the work of Banyaga {{cite:9f67f2c6-8163-4b50-9e2b-847546ecb792}}, {{cite:80e30d37-400a-4da5-8b3b-a5f1b325c2e6}}, the algebraic structure of the group FORMULA  of
smooth compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of FORMULA  is quite well understood: there exists a group
homomorphism, defined by Calabi {{cite:8723687b-a1eb-45b9-ae9d-0a277c1f0ee8}}
FORMULA 
whose kernel FORMULA  is a simple group.
The Calabi homomorphism is defined as follows. Let FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be a compactly supported
Hamiltonian function generating FORMULA , i.e., a smooth function FORMULA  such that:

FORMULA  is the time one map of the flow FORMULA  of the only time dependent vector field FORMULA 
satisfying at any time FORMULA ,
FORMULA 

there exists a compact set in FORMULA  that contains all the supports of the functions FORMULA , for
FORMULA .

Then, by definition,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is half the dimension of FORMULA . This expression does not depend on the choice of the generating function FORMULA ,
and gives a group homomorphism.

Question and result
We consider the following question.
Question 1.2.1 To which groups of homeomorphisms does the Calabi homomorphism extend?

Note that the Calabi homomorphism does not behave continuously with respect to the FORMULA -topology, as shows the
following example.
Example 1.2.2. Let FORMULA , and consider the sequence FORMULA  in
FORMULA  given by
FORMULA 
This sequence converges in the FORMULA -sense to FORMULA , but one can easily check that its Calabi invariant remains
constant.

We will define three interesting groups of homeomorphisms, denoted FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , and prove the following
result.
Theorem 1.2.3 The Calabi homomorphism extends to a group homomorphism FORMULA . Moreover, we
have the following inclusions FORMULA .

We will give the full definitions of FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  in Section . Let us still give
here an idea of what they are:
 FORMULA
is the identity component of the group of compactly supported symplectic bilipschitz homeomorphisms
whose flux is zero (see Section REF ).
 FORMULA
is the group generated by the homeomorphisms that admit particular generating functions (see Section REF ).
 FORMULA
is the group of homeomorphisms FORMULA  such that (on some interval where it is well defined) the isotopy
FORMULA  is a FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopy (in the sense of {{cite:1138c20b-ddac-4e45-b250-b4db7b282fde}}). Here, FORMULA  denotes the flow
generated by the Liouville vector field FORMULA , and FORMULA  (see Section ).


Remark 1.2.4. In the special case of the (2-dimensional) open disk, the fact that the Calabi homomorphism extends to FORMULA  was
already proved by Haissinsky {{cite:894e3470-6638-4e02-a176-4f649614cbc9}}Area preserving quasiconformal maps of the plane are
bilipschitz. Therefore, Haissinsky's result is precisely the fact that the Calabi homomorphism extends to FORMULA .. His
methods are completely different.
Let us also mention that Gambaudo and Ghys have proved that two diffeomorphisms of the disk that are conjugated by an
area preserving homeomorphism have same Calabi invariant {{cite:211b3931-55b0-4c67-bc7b-11f746e8bbcc}}.


Motivation
Our motivation for this work comes from two distinct problems. The first one comes from the following question which
remains open.
Question 1.3.1 (Fathi {{cite:17d8a2f5-0fb6-403f-9eb6-a74776e1d65e}}) Is the group FORMULA  of compactly supported area preserving homeomorphisms
of the disk a simple group ?

Several non-trivial normal subgroups of FORMULA  have been defined by Ghys {{cite:80e30d37-400a-4da5-8b3b-a5f1b325c2e6}},
Müller-Oh {{cite:da0482dc-4791-4153-aa40-0c9286dd252b}} and recently by Le Roux {{cite:71d5b22e-3be7-42f1-80da-241163bf695a}}. But so far, no one has been able to prove that any of
them is a proper subgroup.
Our study is inspired by the work of Müller and Oh. They introduced on any symplectic manifold FORMULA  a group
denoted FORMULA , whose elements are homeomorphisms called hameomorphisms (as the contraction of
"Hamiltonian homeomorphisms"). This group contains all compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and, in the case
of the disk, forms a normal subgroup of FORMULA . A. Fathi noticed that if one could extend the
Calabi homomorphism to the group of hameomorphisms, then it would be necessarily a proper subgroup, and
FORMULA  would not be simple.
In the present paper, we propose a different approach: instead of constructing a group which is known to be normal but
on which it is unknown whether the Calabi homomorphism extends, we construct a group to which the Calabi invariant
extends but for which it is unknown whether it is normal.
Another motivation is a very natural general problem: how can one generalize Hamiltonian dynamics in a
non-smooth context? or (less optimistic) which properties of Hamiltonian maps can be extended? The present paper
concentrates on a particular aspect: the Calabi homomorphism.
Our interest in the groups FORMULA  and FORMULA  comes from the fact that they give large families of examples of elements of
FORMULA , but also from the fact they are quite natural generalizations of the Hamiltonian group, which could be
considered to study the extension of other aspects of Hamiltonian dynamics. As an example, all the rigidity results
obtained on Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms using generating functions technics may also hold for the elements of FORMULA 
(and thus of FORMULA ).
Several other possible groups generalizing the Hamiltonian group have already been considered in literature. The group
FORMULA  mentioned above is one of them, another has been studied by the author in {{cite:1a8cf0bb-c031-46f8-9b20-0e23efa298f3}}. But this
direction of research is still to be developed.

The three groups
The group  FORMULA
The group FORMULA  can be characterised as the set of all symplectic diffeomorphism which are compactly
supported, isotopic to the identity and with zero flux. It is thus natural to introduce the following definition.
Definition 2.1.1 We denote by FORMULA  the identity component of the group of compactly supported
bilipschitz (for some Riemannian metric) symplectic homeomorphisms whose flux is zero.

Remark 2.1.2. Since Lipschitz maps are almost everywhere differentiable, the pull-back of a differential form by a bilipschitz map is
well-defined as a differentiable form with FORMULA  coefficients. Therefore, as in the smooth case, a bilipschitz
homeomorphism FORMULA  of FORMULA  is symplectic if FORMULA , and has zero flux if the one form
FORMULA  is exact (recall that FORMULA  is supposed to be exact, with Liouville form FORMULA ).
Note that a bilipschitz homeomorphism which is the FORMULA -limit of smooth symplectomorphisms is symplectic in this
sense.


The group  FORMULA
The group FORMULA  is another natural generalisation of the Hamiltonian group, based on the notion of generating function,
that we describe now.
First recall that, according to Weinstein's Neighbourhood Theorem {{cite:20f8bfef-61e1-466a-9f48-742e4044a84c}}, there exists a neighbourhood FORMULA  of
the diagonal FORMULA  in the symplectic manifold FORMULA , symplectomorphic to a
neighbourhood of the zero section in the cotangent FORMULA  and hence to a neighbourhood FORMULA  of the zero section in
FORMULA . We will denote FORMULA  such a symplectomorphism, and call it a Weinstein chart.
Now, for any symplectic diffeomorphism FORMULA  of FORMULA , the image of its graph
FORMULA 
is a lagrangian submanifold in FORMULA . Moreover, FORMULA  is exact
if and only if FORMULA  is Hamiltonian. If in addition FORMULA  is sufficiently close to the identity in the FORMULA -sense,
FORMULA  is the graph of the differential of a smooth compactly supported function FORMULA :
FORMULA 
We then say that FORMULA  admits FORMULA  as a generating function.
Since any Hamiltonian diffeomorphism can be written as a product of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms FORMULA -close to the
identity, the group FORMULA  can be characterized as the subgroup of the diffeomorphisms of FORMULA  generated by
the elements that admit smooth compactly supported generating functions. When one tries to extend a property of
Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms to homeomorphisms (the Calabi invariant in our case), it is thus natural to consider
homeomorphisms that admits generating functions. This idea leads to the following definition.
Definition 2.2.1 A FORMULA  compactly supported function FORMULA  is called an admissible generating
function if there exist a homeomorphism FORMULA  of FORMULA , and a symplectic diffeomorphism FORMULA  between a neighbourhood FORMULA 
of the diagonal in FORMULA  and a neighbourhood FORMULA  of the zero section in FORMULA  such that

FORMULA ,

FORMULA ,

FORMULA .

The homeomorphism FORMULA  associated to FORMULA  is called an admissible homeomorphism.
An admissible generating function is called super-admissible if it is the limit in the FORMULA -sense of a
sequence of FORMULA  admissible generating functions. A super-admissible homeomorphism is an
admissible homeomorphism associated to a super-admissible generating function.
We denote by FORMULA  the group generated by homeomorphisms FORMULA  for which there exists some real number FORMULA  such
that for any FORMULA  in FORMULA , the conjugation by the Liouville flow FORMULA  is also
super-admissible.

Remark 2.2.2. As in the introduction, FORMULA  denotes the flow (when it is defined) of the Liouville vector field FORMULA , at
time FORMULA  and point FORMULA . Note that it satisfies FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be a compactly supported homeomorphism of FORMULA . Then there exists a real number FORMULA , such that for any
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are well defined on the support of FORMULA . Thus, the conjugation
FORMULA  is well defined on FORMULA . In the complement of this set, it is the
identity where it is defined. Therefore, we can extend it to a well defined homeomorphism still denoted
FORMULA  just by setting it to equal the identity where it is not defined.

Even though the definition of FORMULA  looks quite strange, it is quite a large group. Indeed, it contains the group
FORMULA , as stated in Theorem REF , and it also contains a large family of examples, that we shall
construct in section .

The group  FORMULA
To define the group FORMULA  we first need the following notion.
Definition 2.3.1 (Müller-Oh {{cite:da0482dc-4791-4153-aa40-0c9286dd252b}}) A FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopy is a path FORMULA  of homeomorphisms of FORMULA 
for which there exist a compact set FORMULA  and a sequence of smooth Hamiltonian functions FORMULA  on FORMULA  with support in
FORMULA , such that

FORMULA  converges to some continuous function FORMULA  in the FORMULA -sense,

FORMULA  converges to FORMULA  in the FORMULA -sense, uniformly in FORMULA .

The function FORMULA  is called a FORMULA -Hamiltonian function generating FORMULA .

Remark 2.3.2. The elements of FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopies are symplectic homeomorphisms,
i.e., homeomorphisms which are the FORMULA  limit of a sequence of symplectic diffeomorphisms supported in a common
compact set.
It is not difficult to check that if FORMULA  and FORMULA  are two FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopies generated by FORMULA  and
FORMULA , then FORMULA  and FORMULA  are FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopies generated by
FORMULA  and FORMULA , and that if FORMULA  is any symplectic homeomorphism,
FORMULA  is a FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopy generated by FORMULA . This means that the computations
are the same as in the smooth case.

The main result concerning FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopies is:
Theorem 2.3.3 (Viterbo {{cite:72ce1fbf-a100-4317-b837-8144ac300608}}) A given FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopy is generated by a unique FORMULA -Hamiltonian
function.

This theorem is the only non-trivial result needed in this paper. Its proof needs at some point a (hard!) rigidity
result in symplectic topology due to Gromov.
By Remark REF , for any compactly supported homeomorphism FORMULA  the commutator
FORMULA 
is well defined, for FORMULA  small enough.
Definition 2.3.4 We denote by FORMULA  the set of all compactly supported symplectic homeomorphisms FORMULA  for
which there exists some FORMULA  small
enough, such that the isotopy FORMULA  is a FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopy.

Clearly, FORMULA  contains FORMULA .
Proposition 2.3.5  The set FORMULA  is a group. Moreover, if the first compactly supported cohomology group FORMULA  vanishes,
FORMULA  does not depend on the choice of the Liouville vector field.

8mm Proof .
—  Let FORMULA . For FORMULA  small enough FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopies. Then, note that
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
We conclude with Remark REF  that
FORMULA  is a group.
Suppose now that FORMULA , and that FORMULA  is the flow of another Liouville vector field. Then,
FORMULA  is a smooth symplectic isotopy which is Hamiltonian since FORMULA . Using once
again Remark REF  and the identity
FORMULA 
we conclude that FORMULA  would be
the same if it was defined with another Liouville vector field.

Proof of the main theorem
Extension of the Calabi homomorphism
In this section, we prove that the Calabi homomorphism extends to FORMULA . Let us first give a new formula for the
Calabi, for which we need to choose a Liouville form instead of choosing an isotopy.
Lemma 3.1.1 Let FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be the generating
Hamiltonian function of the smooth Hamiltonian isotopy FORMULA . Then,
FORMULA 

First note that if FORMULA  is the time one map of some Hamiltonian function FORMULA , and if we suppose
FORMULA  to be well defined, then it can be generated by the Hamiltonian function
FORMULA . After an easy change of variables in Equation (REF ), one gets
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is half the dimension of FORMULA . Thus,
FORMULA 
Hence, applying formula (REF ) to FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Now, letting FORMULA  converge to 0, we get the desired formula.
Once this formula obtained, extending the Calabi homomorphism to FORMULA  is very easy, even though it relies on the "hard
symplectic topology" uniqueness Theorem REF .
let FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be the
unique FORMULA -Hamiltonian function generating FORMULA  for some small FORMULA . We
set:
FORMULA 
By Lemma REF , FORMULA  coincide with FORMULA  on FORMULA . Moreover using Remark
REF  and the formulas in the proof of Proposition REF , one checks easily that
FORMULA  is a group homomorphism.
Remark 3.1.2. If FORMULA , then FORMULA  does not depend on the choice of the Liouville vector field.
This is an immediate consequence of Equation REF .


Proof of the inclusion  FORMULA
We are going to prove that an element of FORMULA  which is sufficiently close to the identity in the bilipschitz sense is
a super-admissible homeomorphism (Definition REF ). Since any element FORMULA  of FORMULA  can be written as a
product of elements of FORMULA  close to the identity (simply cut any path joining FORMULA  to the identity in small pieces),
this will imply that FORMULA  is included in FORMULA . This fact is standard for diffeomorphisms, and is not more difficult
in the bilipschitz case.
Let FORMULA , close enough to the identity in the bilipschitz sense. Then, in particular FORMULA  is FORMULA -close to the
identity and its graph lies in the domain of a Weinstein chart FORMULA . Now, the map FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is Lipschitz close to the diagonal inclusion FORMULA . As a consequence, the conjugated map FORMULA  is Lipschitz-close to the zero section of the cotangent bundle FORMULA . Standard
arguments (the same as in the FORMULA  case) then show that the image of FORMULA  is the graph of the section FORMULA  of FORMULA 
given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the canonical projection. Moreover, this section FORMULA 
is Lipschitz-close to the zero section.
It remains to prove that the Lipschitz 1-form FORMULA  is exact. This follows from the fact that the flux of the
homeomorphism FORMULA  vanishes. Indeed, since FORMULA  has zero flux, for any Liouville form FORMULA , FORMULA  is an exact one form on FORMULA . Since the map FORMULA  is homotopic to the map
FORMULA , this implies that the pull-back of any primitive of FORMULA  is exact. Let FORMULA 
denotes the standard Liouville form on FORMULA , one has FORMULA  hence FORMULA  is exact. It follows that FORMULA  is exact.
Now, if we denote by FORMULA  the compactly supported primitive of FORMULA , it is a FORMULA -function which is admissible by
construction. Moreover, it is small in the FORMULA  sense and thus can be approximated in the FORMULA  sense by
FORMULA -small smooth functions. But it is well known that FORMULA -small smooth functions are admissible. Therefore, FORMULA  is
super-admissible.
Finally, for FORMULA  small enough, FORMULA  remains Lipschitz-close to the identity. Thus, FORMULA  is one
of the generators of FORMULA . FORMULA

Proof of the inclusion  FORMULA
Theorem REF  clearly follows from the following proposition. We denote by FORMULA  the admissible
homeomorphism associated to an admissible generating function FORMULA .
Proposition 3.3.1 Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be a FORMULA  path of super-admissible generating functions,
associated to a fixed Weinstein chart, which is the FORMULA -limit of a smooth path of smooth admissible generating
functions. Then, the path FORMULA  is a FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopy.

Remark 3.3.2. We can construct examples of such paths using Darboux coordinates (see Section  below). By the way,
this proposition gives new examples of FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopies. As an example, the argument shows that any
Lipschitz continuous path in FORMULA  is a FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopy.

To prove Proposition REF , we will need two (classical) lemmas.
Lemma 3.3.3 Let FORMULA  be a Weinstein chart. For any integer FORMULA , the map FORMULA  is a homeomorphism between the set of FORMULA  admissible
generating functions associated to FORMULA  (endowed with the FORMULA -topology) and the set of FORMULA  admissible
(diffeo)homeomorphisms associated to FORMULA  (endowed with the FORMULA -topology).

8mm Proof .
—  The details of the proof of this lemma will be left to the reader. We just give here the idea: as in the previous
section, we use the relation between FORMULA  and FORMULA . Denote FORMULA . Then by
construction, FORMULA  is invertible and one has
FORMULA 
This gives continuity properties of FORMULA .
Conversely, if we consider FORMULA  the projection on the first factor, and denote FORMULA , then by construction, FORMULA  is invertible and one has
FORMULA 
This
allows to prove continuity properties for FORMULA .
    FORMULA

Lemma 3.3.4 Let FORMULA  be a smooth path of smooth admissible generating functions associated
to a fixed Weinstein chart and denote FORMULA  the compactly
supported Hamiltonian function that generates the Hamiltonian isotopy FORMULA . Then,
FORMULA 

In FORMULA , this formula is just the classical Hamilton-Jacobi Equation.
8mm Proof .
—  We set FORMULA , FORMULA , and denote by FORMULA  the canonical
Liouville form on FORMULA . We have seen in the proof of Lemma REF  that FORMULA .
We first pull back the Liouville form. Since FORMULA  for any 1-form FORMULA  on FORMULA ,
FORMULA . We thus have:
FORMULA 
We then take derivative with respect to FORMULA :
FORMULA 
But since FORMULA  is symplectic, FORMULA  hence
FORMULA 
Therefore, after taking (compactly supported) primitive, we get:
FORMULA 
It remains to show that FORMULA . To see this, recall that for any one form FORMULA  on FORMULA , the pullback FORMULA  by the
canonical projection coincides with FORMULA  on the image of FORMULA  (which is a smooth submanifold of FORMULA ).
Then,
FORMULA 
 This concludes our proof.
    FORMULA

8mm Proof of Proposition REF .
—  
Let FORMULA  be our path of generating functions. By assumption, there is a sequence of smooth paths of smooth
admissible generating functions FORMULA  that converges in the FORMULA -sense to FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the generating
Hamiltonian function of the Hamiltonian isotopy FORMULA .
By Lemma REF , the isotopies FORMULA  FORMULA -converge to FORMULA . Moreover,
by Lemma REF , the Hamiltonian functions
FORMULA 
also FORMULA -converge. This shows that FORMULA  is a
FORMULA -Hamiltonian isotopy.
    FORMULA


Examples in  FORMULA
In this section, we give some examples of elements in FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA . Using local Darboux coordinates, they
can of course be implanted in other symplectic manifolds.
Examples of elements in  FORMULA
In FORMULA , there exists globally defined Weinstein charts sending the diagonal to the zero section in FORMULA .
We will use the following one:
FORMULA 
In this Weinstein chart, admissible homeomorphisms and admissible generating functions are associated by the following
relation:
FORMULA 
Therefore, admissible generating function are the compactly supported FORMULA  functions FORMULA  such that

for all FORMULA , the map FORMULA  is a homeomorphism of FORMULA ,

for all FORMULA , the map
FORMULA  is a homeomorphism of FORMULA .

Proposition 4.1.1 
Any compactly supported FORMULA  function FORMULA  such that, in any point FORMULA  the maps
FORMULA 
are increasing
homeomorphisms of FORMULA , is a super-admissible generating function.

8mm Proof .
—  First, such a function is admissible: for any FORMULA  the maps FORMULA 
and FORMULA  are homeomorphisms of FORMULA .
Indeed, one see easily that FORMULA  is continuous and injective. Since it is compactly
supported, it is also proper and hence is an embedding. Finally, this implies that it is onto, because otherwise its
image would contain non-contractible spheres FORMULA . The same argument holds for FORMULA .
Let us now show that FORMULA  can be approximated in the FORMULA -sense by smooth generating functions.
Let FORMULA  be a smooth non-negative function, defined on FORMULA , whose support is contained in a disk centered in 0
and with integral equal to 1. For any positive integer FORMULA , we set FORMULA . Then, it is well
known that the sequence of smooth functions FORMULA  defined by
FORMULA 
FORMULA -converges to FORMULA  as FORMULA  goes to infinity. Moreover, there exists a compact set that contains the supports of
every FORMULA .
let us now prove that the FORMULA  are admissible generating functions. Set
FORMULA 
According to the first part of the proof, it is enough to prove that for
any indices FORMULA , the maps FORMULA  and FORMULA  are increasing homeomorphisms of FORMULA . They are clearly continuous. Since they are
compactly supported, we only need to show that they are increasing. Let us prove it for FORMULA . The proof is similar for the others.
Fix FORMULA  and FORMULA  and denote FORMULA  and FORMULA . We want to
compare FORMULA  with FORMULA . By assumption, for all
FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
thus the following integral is non-negative:
FORMULA 
It is moreover positive because it is the integral of a non-negative continuous function which is non-identically zero.
This integral is nothing but FORMULA . Therefore the
map FORMULA  is an increasing homeomorphism of FORMULA .
    FORMULA

Remark 4.1.2. The conjugation FORMULA  by the Liouville flow FORMULA  of an homeomorphism FORMULA  associated to a
generating function FORMULA  like in Proposition REF , is also admissible and is associated to the
generating function FORMULA . This function satisfies the hypothesis of Proposition
REF  and hence is also a super-admissible generating function. It follows that such a FORMULA 
is in FORMULA .

Remark 4.1.3. Any generating function like in Proposition REF , which is not
FORMULA , gives rise to an example of element which is in FORMULA  but not in FORMULA .


Fibered rotations in  FORMULA
By definition a fibered rotation is an homeomorphism FORMULA  of FORMULA  described in polar coordinates
FORMULA  by the formula
FORMULA 
for some continuous angular function FORMULA  with bounded support. It is easily checked that
any fibered rotation lies in the identity component of the group of compactly supported area preserving homeomorphism
of FORMULA .
We consider FORMULA  the Liouville flow given by FORMULA . Its commutator with a fibered
rotation is given by
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  is moreover a diffeomorphism, the generating Hamiltonian of the isotopy FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
Now suppose that FORMULA  is a continuous and integrable angular function, such that FORMULA  converges to 0 when FORMULA 
tends to 0. Suppose also that FORMULA  is a sequence of smooth compactly supported angular functions (in particular
they vanish nearby 0) that converges uniformly to FORMULA  on any compact subset of FORMULA . Then, clearly, the
associated sequence of fibered rotations FORMULA  converges in the FORMULA -sense to FORMULA , and the sequence of
Hamiltonians FORMULA  generating the isotopies FORMULA  also FORMULA -converges.
As a consequence, any fibered rotation associated to an integrable angular function FORMULA  such that
FORMULA , belongs to FORMULA .
Remark 4.2.1. This gives examples of elements that are in FORMULA  but not in FORMULA : if FORMULA  is not finite (nearby 0),
the fibered rotation FORMULA  cannot be in FORMULA . Indeed, the angle between a vector and its image by an admissible
homeomorphism is bounded by FORMULA . Therefore, this angle has to be finite for elements of FORMULA .
