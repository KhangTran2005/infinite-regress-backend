Introduction
Most of exponential speed-up of quantum computational algorithms
can be regarded as solving group-theoretical problems
that can be formulated within the framework of hidden subgroup problem (HSP).
Mathematically, HSP can be cast in the following terms;
given a finite group FORMULA  and
an oracle function (or black-box function) FORMULA  from FORMULA  to some finite set,
we say that FORMULA  hides a subgroup FORMULA  of FORMULA 
provided that FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  for all FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA 
(that is, FORMULA  and FORMULA  belong to the same right coset of FORMULA ),
and the task is to determine the subgroup FORMULA .
Whereas no classical algorithm is known to solve HSP
with polynomial query complexity
as well as with polynomial running time in the size of the group,
for every abelian group
there exists a quantum algorithm
which can efficiently solve the problem {{cite:b91b69d2-a5cf-420c-8899-483fecfa9759}}, {{cite:ac5cdb5e-7916-436d-968f-014159249ade}}, {{cite:a027df60-3cb2-4a8d-9af2-b9936b1d67e0}},
and furthermore for an arbitrary group
there exists a quantum algorithm
which can solve the problem
with polynomial quantum query complexity {{cite:bd739d39-ca39-4aa0-9355-6836c3c8edc1}}.
In other words, HSP on an abelian group FORMULA  can be solved
by a quantum algorithm of running time polynomial in FORMULA ,
and HSP on non-abelian groups can be solved
by quantum algorithms with polynomial query complexity,
although the algorithms cannot efficiently solve the problem in general.
HSP includes several algorithmically important problems;
graph isomorphism problem can be reduced to the HSP on the symmetric group
and certain lattice problems can be reduced to the HSP on the dihedral group {{cite:c7c56195-21b0-4c0c-80df-d6511166737f}}, {{cite:b5acafbb-cfc5-4904-b7ee-328109c593b8}}.
For these reasons, a lot of attempts have been made
to generalize the quantum solution of the abelian HSP
to non-abelian cases {{cite:4a948567-638f-4fb5-888e-d27f9ec18891}}, {{cite:317282ac-edfa-48b7-b788-c2482e14f15e}}, {{cite:152b1bee-481d-4187-8175-6e0ec47c82a1}}, {{cite:03f4ee6b-5249-4387-8239-15b16079268e}}, {{cite:a5058ba2-e77f-49a4-a7b5-62ae3d647c13}}, {{cite:a7e058c5-55c8-4dfb-aaaa-e51ca443e4d8}}, {{cite:53518be6-701e-49f3-ab66-552b7aa5855f}}, {{cite:d8c270e0-b541-469e-b0d2-3df110fff14a}}, {{cite:669c6042-9f16-466a-bee8-61623c7a4e11}}, {{cite:998496f4-577b-4f10-a1bf-f410c529f429}}.
However, the HSP for the dihedral and symmetric groups still remains unsolved.
Furthermore, the methods for solving HSP of abelian cases are known to fail for
several non-abelian groups {{cite:11a59291-7342-463a-9f83-f947d5139434}}, {{cite:6cead157-acad-4493-be68-0e89f59b068d}}. Thus a direct generalization of quantum solutions
for abelian HSP to non-abelian cases seems rather exclusive.
Another approach toward the study of HSP is to generalize the problem itself, that is, to consider problems
dealing with more general properties of algebraic sets hidden by the oracle functions.
One of these problems is the hidden symmetry subgroup problem (HSSP) {{cite:a4c7bdcf-65f4-4098-8eb0-425e59da7cc3}},
which can be formulated as follows;
for a group FORMULA  acting on some finite set FORMULA 
and an oracle function whose level sets define a partition of FORMULA  by the group action,
the object we would like to recover is the group of symmetries of this partition inside FORMULA ,
that is, the subgroup whose orbits under the action coincide with the classes of the partition,
as we will see the details in Section .
HSP can be regarded as a special case of the HSSP
when the group acts on itself and the action corresponds to the group operation.
However, certain cases of the HSSP have exponential quantum query complexity,
in contrast to the fact that the quantum query complexity of HSP for any group is polynomial.
Thus we can say that HSSP is generally harder than HSP for some actions.
Recently, Decker, Ivanyos, Santha and Wocjan presented
an efficient quantum algorithm for HSSP on the Frobenius group,
which includes a large variety of affine groups as a special case, by showing that
HSSP is indeed efficiently reducible to HSP
when the action has an efficiently computable generalized base,
and that such bases for a large class of Frobenius groups
can be efficiently constructed {{cite:a4c7bdcf-65f4-4098-8eb0-425e59da7cc3}}.
In this paper,
we first investigate algebraic properties of semi-direct product of cyclic groups,
and then construct an efficient reduction scheme of HSSP on FORMULA  to its related HSP
for the case when any prime factor FORMULA  of FORMULA 
satisfies the condition that FORMULA  is not divisible by FORMULA .
Finally, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm
for HSSP on the group
by applying this reduction scheme to
an efficient quantum computational algorithm for the related HSP {{cite:04ff3459-660c-4605-9748-180ff6c04122}}.
This paper is organized as follows.
In Section 
we briefly review some algebraic properties and the definition of HSSP,
and in Section 
we recall a sufficient condition of group actions proposed in {{cite:a4c7bdcf-65f4-4098-8eb0-425e59da7cc3}},
under which a HSSP can be reduced in polynomial time to a HSP.
In Section 
we provide some homomorphic properties of semi-direct product of cyclic groups,
and characterize its stabilizer subgroups,
and in Section 
we show that there exist an efficient quantum algorithm
which can solve HSSP on FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is an odd prime number
which does not divide FORMULA  for any of the prime factors FORMULA  of FORMULA .
Finally, we summarize our result in Section .

Preliminaries
A group action of a group FORMULA  on a set FORMULA  is
a binary function FORMULA  (with the notation FORMULA  = FORMULA ),
which satisfies FORMULA 
and FORMULA  for any FORMULA , FORMULA  and the identity element FORMULA  of FORMULA .
We denote FORMULA  for a subset FORMULA .
For each FORMULA , its stabilizer subgroup FORMULA  is defined as FORMULA ,
which consists of the elements in FORMULA  fixing FORMULA  under the group action.
The group action FORMULA  of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is faithful
if FORMULA , that is,
FORMULA  is the only element of FORMULA  that fixes every element of FORMULA .
For any subgroup FORMULA  of FORMULA ,
FORMULA  also acts naturally on FORMULA .
The FORMULA -orbit of FORMULA 
is the subset of FORMULA  defined as FORMULA .
The FORMULA -orbits form a partition FORMULA  of FORMULA .
For a partition FORMULA  of the set FORMULA ,
the group of symmetries of FORMULA 
is the subgroup FORMULA ,
which consists of the elements stabilizing every class of the
partition FORMULA  under the group action.
The subgroup FORMULA  of FORMULA  is the closure of FORMULA  {{cite:498142a3-f8b1-4432-9382-538b4cf4addc}},
which consists of the elements in FORMULA  stabilizing every FORMULA -orbit.
The closure of a partition FORMULA  is FORMULA ,
which consists of the orbits of its group of symmetries.
We note that FORMULA  is always a subgroup of FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is said to be closed if FORMULA , that is,
there exists a partition FORMULA  such that FORMULA .
Similarly, FORMULA  is said to be closed if FORMULA .
We denote by FORMULA  the family of all closed subgroups in FORMULA .
Now let us recall the formal definition of the HSSP {{cite:a4c7bdcf-65f4-4098-8eb0-425e59da7cc3}};
for a finite group FORMULA , a finite set FORMULA ,
an action FORMULA  and a family FORMULA  of closed subgroups of FORMULA ,
let us assume that an oracle function FORMULA  is given,
which is defined on FORMULA  to some finite set FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  for some subgroup FORMULA .
The HSSP is to determine the subgroup FORMULA .
The subsets of FORMULA  whose elements have the same
function value of FORMULA  form a partition of FORMULA , denoted by FORMULA .
Each party of this partition is called a level set of FORMULA .
Although there can be several subgroups of FORMULA  whose orbits coincide with
the level sets of FORMULA , the closures of these subgroups are the
same. The unique closed subgroup that satisfies the promise is
FORMULA , and this is the output of the HSSP.
(FORMULA  is said to hide FORMULA  by symmetries.)
For a prime power FORMULA , the general affine group FORMULA  is
the group of invertible affine transformations over the FORMULA ,
which can be represented as the semi-direct product of groups;
for finite groups FORMULA , FORMULA 
and a homomorphism FORMULA  from FORMULA  to the group of automorphisms of FORMULA ,
the semi-direct product of FORMULA  and FORMULA , denoted by FORMULA ,
is the cartesian product of FORMULA  and FORMULA  with the group operation defined as
FORMULA .
(We use the notation FORMULA  for FORMULA 
whenever FORMULA  is clear from the context.)
Using the notion of semi-direct product,
FORMULA  can be represented as FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  denotes the multiplicative group of FORMULA .
The natural group action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is defined as FORMULA .
For each FORMULA , the stabilizer of FORMULA  is the subgroup FORMULA .
FORMULA  is a closed subgroup,
and it has two orbits FORMULA  and FORMULA .
By letting FORMULA ,
Grover's search over FORMULA  to find FORMULA  can be regarded as
a HSSP to find a closed subgroup FORMULA  in FORMULA ;
for any input FORMULA  and the oracle function FORMULA  such that
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the Kronecker delta,
FORMULA  hides FORMULA  as a symmetry subgroup.
Since we can recover FORMULA  from any generator FORMULA  of FORMULA 
simply by computing FORMULA ,
the query complexity of the HSSP is at least that of Grover's search.
Because Grover's search has query complexity FORMULA  {{cite:caa6706c-348b-4c8f-9b5d-23ee4de32c66}},
it can be shown that
the query complexity of HSSP on the affine group FORMULA  over
FORMULA  is FORMULA .

A reduction scheme of HSSP to HSP
In this section, we recall a general condition of the group action,
under which a HSSP can be reduced in polynomial time to a HSP {{cite:a4c7bdcf-65f4-4098-8eb0-425e59da7cc3}}.
For a given oracle function FORMULA  over FORMULA ,
which hides some subgroup FORMULA  of FORMULA  by symmetries,
we construct a suitable function FORMULA  over FORMULA , which hides FORMULA .
Definition 1 
For a finite group FORMULA  and a group action FORMULA  of FORMULA  on the finite set FORMULA ,
let FORMULA  be a subgroup of FORMULA , and FORMULA  be a family of subgroups of FORMULA  including FORMULA .
A set FORMULA  is said to be an FORMULA -strong base if
FORMULA 
for every FORMULA  and the stabilizer subgroup FORMULA  of FORMULA .
FORMULA  is said to be an FORMULA -strong base
when it is FORMULA -strong for every subgroup FORMULA .

We note that FORMULA .
Thus FORMULA  itself is always a FORMULA -strong base.
Furthermore, if FORMULA  is an FORMULA -strong base,
then FORMULA  is also an FORMULA -strong base for every FORMULA .
Therefore, we can show that
if FORMULA  consists of conjugated subgroups
then FORMULA  becomes an FORMULA -strong base
when it is an FORMULA -strong base for some FORMULA ,
and that if FORMULA  is closed under conjugation by elements of FORMULA  then
FORMULA  is an FORMULA -strong base if and only if
FORMULA  for every FORMULA .
Based on the concept of FORMULA -strong bases,
the authors in Ref. {{cite:a4c7bdcf-65f4-4098-8eb0-425e59da7cc3}} proposed a reduction scheme from a HSSP to a HSP.
Proposition 1 
Let FORMULA  be a finite group, and let FORMULA  be an action of FORMULA  on FORMULA .
Suppose that the function FORMULA  hides some FORMULA  by symmetries.
Let FORMULA  be an FORMULA -strong base.
Then FORMULA  is hidden by the function FORMULA .

Proposition REF  implies that
if we can choose a proper subset FORMULA  of FORMULA ,
which is an FORMULA -strong base,
the HSSP can always be reduced to the HSP.
Furthermore, it naturally leads us to the following proposition,
which provides a sufficient condition
for a polynomial-time reducibility of HSSP to its related HSP.
Proposition 2 
Let FORMULA  be a finite group, FORMULA  a finite set, FORMULA  a polynomial time computable
action of FORMULA  on FORMULA , and FORMULA  a family of subgroups of FORMULA .
If there exists an efficiently computable FORMULA -strong base
in FORMULA , then HSSP on the group FORMULA  is polynomial time reducible to HSP of FORMULA .

When the group FORMULA  is a semi-direct product group,
an efficient characterization of FORMULA -strong base {{cite:a4c7bdcf-65f4-4098-8eb0-425e59da7cc3}} has been proposed as follows.
Let us assume that FORMULA  is isomorphic to the semi-direct product of its subgroups FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
that is, FORMULA .
The group action defined here is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  for some FORMULA  and FORMULA .
If we consider the set FORMULA  consisting of the all conjugate groups of FORMULA ,
that is, FORMULA ,
then being an FORMULA -strong base is equivalent to being an FORMULA -strong base.
For an efficient characterization of FORMULA -strong base,
we recall the concept of separation among elements of FORMULA 
with respect to the group action and its orbits;
for FORMULA  with FORMULA , we say that an element FORMULA  separates FORMULA  and FORMULA  if
FORMULA 
Then the following proposition provides us with
a necessary and sufficient condition to characterize FORMULA -strong base {{cite:a4c7bdcf-65f4-4098-8eb0-425e59da7cc3}}.
Proposition 3 
Let FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is an FORMULA -strong base
if and only if for all FORMULA  in FORMULA 
there exists FORMULA  which separates FORMULA  and FORMULA .


Semi-direct product of cyclic groups
Semi-direct product of cyclic groups and group action
For any positive integer FORMULA  and FORMULA 
and any group homomorphism FORMULA 
from FORMULA  into FORMULA ,
the semi-direct product group FORMULA  is
the set FORMULA 
with the group operation FORMULA .
For any odd prime FORMULA  and positive integer FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
let FORMULA  be the semi-direct product
with respect to a homomorphism FORMULA  from FORMULA  to the
automorphism group FORMULA  of
FORMULA . Because FORMULA  is a homomorphism,
we have
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA  and FORMULA .
We also note that FORMULA  is relatively prime to FORMULA ,
and thus the semi-direct product group FORMULA  is
completely determined by the image of FORMULA  in FORMULA .
For example, if FORMULA , then FORMULA  is the direct product FORMULA .
If FORMULA  then FORMULA  is the smallest positive integer
satisfying
FORMULA 
that is,
FORMULA  is one of elements of FORMULA  with order FORMULA .
Hence, it is straightforward to verify that
FORMULA  is of the form
FORMULA 
for some FORMULA  {{cite:53518be6-701e-49f3-ab66-552b7aa5855f}}.
Thus we assume that FORMULA  to avoid the trivial case of the direct product FORMULA ,
and equivalently use the notions of FORMULA  and FORMULA 
for some FORMULA  throughout this paper.
Let us define two subgroups FORMULA  and FORMULA  of FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
and consider a group action FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA  and FORMULA 
(or equivalently, for any FORMULA  and FORMULA .)
It is clear that
the identity element FORMULA  in FORMULA  is fixed by any element of FORMULA  under the action FORMULA .
Furthermore, the following theorem completely characterizes the elements of FORMULA  that are fixed by FORMULA .
Theorem 1 
For any FORMULA  and FORMULA  satisfying FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is fixed by FORMULA  under the group action FORMULA 
if and only if FORMULA  is not relatively prime to FORMULA .

From the definition of group action in Eq. (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  is not relatively prime to FORMULA ,
then we can assume FORMULA  for some FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Together with Eq. (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
and thus FORMULA  for any FORMULA  if FORMULA 
is not relatively prime to FORMULA .
Conversely, let us suppose that FORMULA  fixes FORMULA 
with FORMULA  being relatively prime to FORMULA .
From Eq. (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
or equivalently, FORMULA  is divided by FORMULA .
Because FORMULA  is relatively prime to FORMULA ,
Eq. (REF ) is true if and only if
FORMULA 
In other words, FORMULA  fixes FORMULA  with respect to the action FORMULA 
if and only if Eq. (REF ) holds.
However, this contradicts to the fact that FORMULA  is the smallest positive integer satisfying Eq. (REF )
since FORMULA .
Thus for any FORMULA  and FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is relatively prime to FORMULA ,
FORMULA  does not fix FORMULA .
Let us define the subset FORMULA  of FORMULA 
where FORMULA  consists of the elements in FORMULA ,
which are not relatively prime to FORMULA .
Then Theorem REF  implies that FORMULA  is the stabilizer subgroup of FORMULA 
that fixes every element in FORMULA .
For this reason, we also denote FORMULA .
Theorem REF  also implies that
the semi-direct product of cyclic groups FORMULA 
for general FORMULA  and FORMULA  under the action in Eq. (REF ) is not a Frobenius group
because, not only the identity element FORMULA ,
every element in FORMULA  has more than one fixed element.
The following theorem shows that the action of FORMULA  on any element of FORMULA  that is not in FORMULA 
is faithful, that is,
for any FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is relatively prime to FORMULA ,
two different elements of FORMULA  lead FORMULA  to different elements in FORMULA  under the action FORMULA .
Theorem 2 For FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is relatively prime to FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA  such that FORMULA .

Suppose FORMULA .
Because FORMULA  is relatively prime to FORMULA , let FORMULA  for some FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
By the assumption,
we have FORMULA ,
which is equivalent to
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is not a zero divisor in FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
However Eq. (REF ) implies FORMULA ,
which contradicts to the fact in Eq. (REF )
stating that FORMULA  is the smallest integer
satisfying FORMULA 
because FORMULA  (without loss of generality, we may assume FORMULA ).
Thus FORMULA .
From Theorem REF  together with Theorem REF ,
we note that the orbits of FORMULA  are singleton subsets FORMULA  of FORMULA 
and some subsets of FORMULA , each consisting of FORMULA  number of elements.
The theorems also implies that FORMULA  is a closed subgroup and its orbits form a closed partition of FORMULA .
In the following subsection,
we will consider the general form of closed subgroups of FORMULA 
and their orbits in accordance of FORMULA .

Stabilizer Subgroups
In this section,
we consider stabilizer subgroups of each element in FORMULA 
with respect to the group action in Eq. (REF ).
Let us first consider a partition of FORMULA ; for each FORMULA ,
we define FORMULA  to be the set of elements in FORMULA 
whose remainder is FORMULA  when divided by FORMULA ,
that is, FORMULA .
It is clear that FORMULA  can be partitioned into subsets FORMULA .
Theorem 3 For any FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA 
is the conjugate subgroup of FORMULA  in FORMULA .

Because FORMULA , FORMULA  for some FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where the last equality is due to
FORMULA 
Now for any FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
which completes the proof.
Now we have the following theorem,
which completely characterizes the stabilizer subgroups of each element in FORMULA .
Theorem 4 For any FORMULA  such that FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is fixed by FORMULA  under the group action
FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  .

Because FORMULA , let FORMULA  for some FORMULA ,
then for any FORMULA  we have,
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
where the last equality is
due to the binomial expansion of FORMULA  under modulo FORMULA .
Now we have
FORMULA 
which implies that any element in FORMULA  fixes FORMULA .
Conversely, suppose that there exists FORMULA 
which fixes FORMULA  under the action FORMULA , that is
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
From Eq. (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
Thus FORMULA , or equivalently
FORMULA 
which completes the proof.
From Theorem REF  and Theorem REF ,
we note that, for each FORMULA ,
the conjugate group FORMULA  of FORMULA 
is the stabilizer group of each elements in FORMULA 
with respect to the group action FORMULA .
Similarly with Theorem REF ,
it is also straightforward to verify
that FORMULA  acts faithfully on any element of FORMULA  that is not in FORMULA .
They are closed subgroups of FORMULA  and their orbits form closed partitions.
We will denote FORMULA  the set of all conjugate subgroups of FORMULA  in FORMULA ;
FORMULA 

Quantum Algorithm for HSSP on  FORMULA
In this section,
we present an efficient quantum algorithm for HSSP defined on FORMULA 
with respect to the group action in Eq. (REF )
and the set of closed subgroups FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ).
By considering an efficient reduction scheme of HSSP defined on FORMULA  onto its related HSP,
we show that there exists a quantum algorithm solving HSSP on FORMULA 
in a polynomial time with respect to the size of the group.
From Propositions REF  and REF ,
we note that for a given set FORMULA  with a set of closed subsets FORMULA ,
there exists a polynomial-time reduction scheme from HSSP to HSP
if we can efficiently construct an FORMULA -strong base of small size.
For the case when FORMULA  is a semi-direct product group,
Proposition REF  provides us
with an efficient way to convince the existence of an FORMULA -strong base.
Furthermore, if the group is a semi-direct product of cyclic groups, FORMULA ,
the following theorem gives a lower bound of the probability
that element in FORMULA  separates given two distinct elements of FORMULA 
with respect to the action in Eq. (REF ).
Theorem 5 For given FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA  with FORMULA 
and a randomly chosen element FORMULA  from FORMULA ,
the probability that FORMULA  separates FORMULA  and FORMULA 
is no less than FORMULA .

Let us suppose that FORMULA  does not separate FORMULA  and FORMULA .
From the definition of separation in (REF ),
we have FORMULA .
In other words, there exists an element FORMULA  in FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
which is equivalent to FORMULA 
by the definition of group action in Eq. (REF ).
Thus FORMULA  does not separate FORMULA  and FORMULA  if and only if
there exists FORMULA  (or equivalently there exists FORMULA ) such that
FORMULA 
Because FORMULA  is a homomorphism, Eq. (REF ) is also equivalent to
FORMULA 
Now we note that the right-hand side of Eq. (REF ) becomes
FORMULA 
where the last equality is by the binomial expansion of FORMULA .
Similarly, the left-hand side of Eq. (REF ) can also be expressed as
FORMULA 
From Eq. (REF ) together with Eq. (REF ) and Eq. (REF ),
we note that
FORMULA  does not separate FORMULA  and FORMULA  if and only if
there exists FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
Case 1: Let us first consider the cases when FORMULA  is not divisible by FORMULA , that is
FORMULA 
for some FORMULA  and FORMULA .
For this case, it is readily seen that
Eq. (REF ) never holds because
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA ,
and thus every FORMULA  in FORMULA  separates FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Case 2: Now let us consider the cases when FORMULA  is divisible by FORMULA , that is,
FORMULA 
for some FORMULA  (because FORMULA , FORMULA ).
For this case, Eq. (REF ) becomes
FORMULA 
which is equivalent to
FORMULA 
for some FORMULA .
Here we note that FORMULA  because FORMULA ,
and also FORMULA  because FORMULA .
In other words, neither FORMULA  nor FORMULA  is a zero divisor in FORMULA ,
and thus their inverse elements also exist in FORMULA .
Furthermore, Eq. (REF ) holds if and only if FORMULA ,
that is,
FORMULA 
for some FORMULA .
Eq. (REF ) implies that
given FORMULA  and FORMULA  satisfying Eq. (REF ),
there are FORMULA  possible choices of FORMULA 
for each FORMULA  such that Eq. (REF ) holds.
In other words, if FORMULA  and FORMULA  satisfy Eq. (REF )
then there are FORMULA  choices of FORMULA  in FORMULA ,
for which FORMULA  does not separate FORMULA  and FORMULA .
For this case, the number of FORMULA  in FORMULA  separating FORMULA  and FORMULA 
is FORMULA ,
which is the number of FORMULA  in FORMULA  that does not satisfy Eq. (REF ).
Now let us consider the probability of randomly chosen FORMULA  in FORMULA 
that separates FORMULA  and FORMULA .
From Case 1 and 2,
we note that every FORMULA  in FORMULA  separates FORMULA  and FORMULA 
if FORMULA  is not divisible by FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is divisible by FORMULA 
then there are FORMULA  number of FORMULA  separating FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Thus the probability of randomly chosen FORMULA  in FORMULA  that separates FORMULA  and FORMULA 
is
FORMULA 
If FORMULA , Eq. (REF ) implies that for every FORMULA  in FORMULA ,
there are FORMULA  number of possible FORMULA  satisfying FORMULA .
Thus the total number of the unordered pairs FORMULA  satisfying FORMULA  is FORMULA 
(the factor FORMULA  is to avoid doubly counting the unordered pair FORMULA ).
Because there are FORMULA  ways to choose FORMULA  from FORMULA ,
we have
FORMULA 
and together with Eq. (REF ),
we have
FORMULA 
Theorem REF  implies that
a randomly chosen element FORMULA  from FORMULA  separates given FORMULA  and FORMULA  with large probability.
In other words,
the probability that a randomly chosen element FORMULA  from FORMULA  does not separate given FORMULA  and FORMULA 
is exponentially small with respect to the logarithm of the size of the group,
when the group is a semi-direct product of cyclic groups.
This idea leads us to the following theorem,
which assures the existence of an FORMULA -strong base of small size with high probability
for this semi-direct product of cyclic groups.
Theorem 6 
Let FORMULA  be the semi-direct product of cyclic groups
with an odd prime FORMULA  and a positive integer FORMULA  such that FORMULA .
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are two subgroups of FORMULA 
where FORMULA  acts on FORMULA  with respect to the group action in Eq. (REF ),
and FORMULA  is the set of all conjugate groups of FORMULA  in FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is a uniformly random set of size FORMULA ,
with FORMULA ,
then FORMULA  is an FORMULA -strong base with probability of at least FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be a uniformly random subset of FORMULA  of size FORMULA .
By Proposition REF ,
it is sufficient to prove that for every FORMULA ,
there exists an element in FORMULA  which separates FORMULA  and FORMULA 
with probability of at least FORMULA .
In this proof, we will consider an upper bound of the probability of the opposite event.
From Theorem REF ,
the probability that a random FORMULA  from FORMULA  does not separate
FORMULA  and FORMULA  for a fixed pair FORMULA 
is at most FORMULA .
Therefore, the probability that none of the elements in FORMULA  separates FORMULA  and FORMULA  is
not more than FORMULA .
Thus, the probability that for some pair FORMULA 
none of the elements in FORMULA  separates FORMULA  and FORMULA  is
less than or equal to FORMULA ,
which is at most FORMULA  by the choice of FORMULA .
For FORMULA ,
Theorem REF  implies that
we can efficiently compute an FORMULA -strong base of small size for the set of closed subgroups FORMULA .
Therefore, by Proposition REF ,
HSSP on FORMULA  is efficiently reduced to a HSP on FORMULA .
Finally, we would like to remark that
there exists a polynomial-time quantum algorithm solving HSP on FORMULA 
for any odd prime FORMULA  and positive integer FORMULA  {{cite:53518be6-701e-49f3-ab66-552b7aa5855f}}, {{cite:04ff3459-660c-4605-9748-180ff6c04122}}.
Thus we can have an efficient quantum algorithm for HSSP on FORMULA .
Corollary 1 
Let FORMULA  be the semi-direct product of cyclic groups with an odd
prime FORMULA  and a positive integer FORMULA  such that FORMULA . FORMULA ,
FORMULA  are two subgroups of FORMULA  where FORMULA  acts on FORMULA  with respect to the group action
in Eq. (REF ) and FORMULA  is the set of all conjugate groups of FORMULA  in FORMULA .
Then there exists a polynomial-time quantum algorithm solving HSSP on FORMULA .

Now, we consider a possible reduction scheme of HSSP defined on FORMULA 
to a HSSP on FORMULA  for some case of FORMULA ,
by using the same arguments as in Ref. {{cite:04ff3459-660c-4605-9748-180ff6c04122}}.
We first consider the case when FORMULA  for some prime FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  and FORMULA  does not divide FORMULA ,
and we further consider more general case of FORMULA .
If FORMULA ,
the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups implies
that FORMULA  is isomorphic to FORMULA ,
and thus we will assume FORMULA .
Similar to the case of HSSP on FORMULA ,
let us consider the subgroups of FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
and the group action FORMULA  defined by
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA  and FORMULA .
(or equivalently, for any FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .)
The set of closed subgroup FORMULA 
is given by the set of all conjugate groups of FORMULA ,
and the oracle function FORMULA  is defined on FORMULA  to some finite set FORMULA 
such that
FORMULA 
for some subgroup FORMULA .
The task of HSSP on FORMULA  is to determine the subgroup FORMULA .
We now take into account the following proposition {{cite:04ff3459-660c-4605-9748-180ff6c04122}}
Proposition 4 
Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be distinct primes satisfying  FORMULA,
then
FORMULA 
for some homomorphism FORMULA  from FORMULA  to FORMULA .

Since FORMULA  is the identity map FORMULA  on FORMULA ,
we have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Since the order of FORMULA  is FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
we obtain that FORMULA  must be 1, that is, FORMULA  trivially acts on FORMULA .
Thus, for each FORMULA ,
FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is the identity map on FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is a homomorphism from FORMULA  to FORMULA .
Therefore, the operation of the semi-direct product group is as follows:
FORMULA 
which implies Eq. (REF ).
Proposition REF  implies that for
any FORMULA , and FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Thus, the set of closed subgroups FORMULA  consists of all conjugate groups of FORMULA 
whose element has 0 in the first coordinate;
FORMULA 
From Theorem REF  in Section REF ,
we have the following corollary.
Corollary 2 For any FORMULA  such that FORMULA ,
FORMULA 

In other words, if we recall Eq. (REF ), which is the set FORMULA  of the closed subgroups defined for the HSSP on FORMULA ,
we note that there exists a natural one-to-one correspondence between FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Now we characterize the group action in Eq. (REF ) and the stabilizer subgroups of each element in FORMULA  under this action.
For any FORMULA  and FORMULA , suppose FORMULA  is fixed by FORMULA  under the action, then we have
FORMULA 
Thus for any FORMULA , if FORMULA  fixes any element FORMULA  in FORMULA  then FORMULA ,
which implies FORMULA .
In other words, FORMULA  belongs to a conjugate group of FORMULA  in FORMULA .
We also note that Eq. (REF ) implies that FORMULA .
Thus we have the following corollary.
Corollary 3 For any FORMULA  such that FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is fixed by FORMULA  under the group action FORMULA 
if and only if FORMULA .

This is a direct consequence from Theorem REF  in Section REF .
From the definition of the oracle function in Eq. (REF ),
we note that for any FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA ,
we have FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA 
for some FORMULA .
By Corollary REF , we also note that
FORMULA  for some FORMULA .
Thus Eq. (REF ) is equivalent to the existence of some FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
From Eq. (REF ) together with Eqs. (REF ) and (REF ), we note that FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA 
for some FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA .
Now for any HSSP defined on FORMULA 
with the set of closed subsets FORMULA 
and the oracle function
FORMULA 
we can always consider
the corresponding HSSP defined on FORMULA  with the set of closed subgroups
FORMULA  and the reduced oracle function
FORMULA  defined on FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
for some FORMULA .
Furthermore, to find FORMULA  in FORMULA  satisfying Eq. (REF )
for any FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA ,
it is enough to find FORMULA  in FORMULA  satisfying Eq. (REF )
for any FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA  due to the one-to-one correspondence between FORMULA  and FORMULA 
with respect to the oracle functions FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively.
Thus we have the following theorem,
which states a natural reduction of HSSP on FORMULA 
to HSSP on FORMULA .
Theorem 7 Any HSSP defined on FORMULA 
with respect to the group action in Eq. (REF )
can be naturally reduced to the HSSP on FORMULA 
with respect to the group action in Eq. (REF ).

Now let us consider a possible reduction of HSSP on FORMULA 
to HSSP on FORMULA  for more general case of FORMULA .
By the fundamental theorem of arithmetics, FORMULA  can be factorized into powers of distinct primes
FORMULA ,
and the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups implies that
FORMULA  is isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups
FORMULA .
Here we consider the case when FORMULA  does not divide each FORMULA  for all FORMULA ,
and we also assume that FORMULA  for some FORMULA 
to avoid the trivial case of abelian group FORMULA .
For convenience, let FORMULA  and FORMULA , then we have
FORMULA 
By an analogous proof of Proposition REF ,
we also note that, for each FORMULA ,
the automorphism FORMULA  on FORMULA 
acts trivially on each component of FORMULA  such that FORMULA  differs from FORMULA .
In other words, there exists a homomorphism FORMULA  from FORMULA  to FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  for each FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the identity map on FORMULA , and
FORMULA 
Furthermore, FORMULA  is
a cyclic group of order FORMULA , thus we have
FORMULA 
Eq. (REF ) implies that
solving HSSP on FORMULA  is essentially equivalent to
solving HSSP on FORMULA 
because two groups are isomorphic.
Now let us consider the subgroups FORMULA ,
FORMULA  of FORMULA 
and the group action FORMULA  defined by
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA  and FORMULA 
(or equivalently, for any FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA ).
By using an analogous argument of Corollaries REF  and REF ,
it is straightforward to verify the one-to-one correspondence
between the set of closed subgroups of FORMULA 
under the group action in Eq. (REF )
and the set of closed subgroups of FORMULA .
Thus we have the following theorem about a natural reduction of HSSP on FORMULA 
to HSSP on FORMULA  for some case of FORMULA .
Theorem 8 Let FORMULA  be a positive integer with a prime factorization FORMULA 
and FORMULA  be an odd prime such that FORMULA  does not divide each FORMULA  for all FORMULA .
Then any HSSP defined on FORMULA  with respect to the group action in Eq. (REF )
can be naturally reduced to the HSSP on FORMULA  with respect to the group action in Eq. (REF ).

Now, together with Corollary REF , we have the following corollary,
which states the existence of a polynomial-time quantum algorithm
solving HSSP on FORMULA  for some case of FORMULA .
Corollary 4 
Let FORMULA  be the semi-direct product of cyclic groups
with an odd prime FORMULA  and a positive integer FORMULA  with a prime factorization FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  does not divide each FORMULA  for all FORMULA .
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are two subgroups of FORMULA 
where FORMULA  acts on FORMULA  with respect to the group action in Eq. (REF )
and FORMULA  is the set of all conjugate groups of FORMULA  in FORMULA .
Then there exists a polynomial-time quantum algorithms solving HSSP on FORMULA .


Summary
We have first investigated algebraic properties of semi-direct product of cyclic groups,
and then have presented an efficient reduction scheme of HSSP on FORMULA  to its related HSP
for the case when any prime factor FORMULA  of FORMULA 
satisfies the condition that FORMULA  is not divisible by FORMULA .
Finally, we have proposed an efficient quantum algorithm for HSSP on the group
by applying this reduction scheme to
an efficient quantum computational algorithm for the related HSP.
