We study the homology jump loci of a chain complex over
an affine FORMULA -algebra. When the chain complex is the first
page of the equivariant spectral sequence associated to
a regular abelian cover of a finite-type CW-complex, we
relate those jump loci to the resonance varieties
associated to the cohomology ring of the space.
As an application, we show that vanishing resonance
implies a certain finiteness property for the completed
Alexander invariants of the space. We also show that,
generically, a connected, finite-dimensional commutative
graded algebra has vanishing resonance.

Introduction
Overview
The study of the homology groups of abelian covers
goes back to the 1920s, when J.W. Alexander
introduced his eponymous knot polynomial.
Given a knot in FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the
universal abelian cover of its complement.
The Alexander polynomial of the knot, then,
is the order of FORMULA , a finitely
generated, torsion module over the group-ring
FORMULA .
More generally, consider a connected, finite-type
CW-complex FORMULA , with fundamental group FORMULA .
The homology groups of FORMULA , with coefficients in FORMULA ab]FORMULA Hi(Xab,FORMULA XFORMULA 1FORMULA We revisit here this theory from a more general point of view.
The key new ingredient in our approach is the equivariant
spectral sequence from {{cite:a552b272-e0e6-460a-b421-95b0fc1132ad}}. Using techniques
from commutative algebra, we establish a tight
connection between the homology jump loci of the first page
of this spectral sequence, on one hand, and the resonance
varieties associated to the cohomology ring of the space,
on the other hand. In turn, this connection allows us to
prove an infinitesimal analogue of the Dwyer–Fried finiteness
test for the completed homology groups of abelian Galois covers.

The equivariant spectral sequence
Let FORMULA  be an epimorphism from
the fundamental group of FORMULA  to a (finitely generated)
abelian group FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be the
corresponding regular cover. The homology groups
of FORMULA  with coefficients in an
algebraically closed field FORMULA  are modules
over the group-ring FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the augmentation ideal of FORMULA . The associated
graded ring, FORMULA , then, is a finitely generated
FORMULA -algebra.
As shown in {{cite:a552b272-e0e6-460a-b421-95b0fc1132ad}}, there is a spectral sequence
that converges to the FORMULA -adic completion of FORMULA .
The first page of this spectral sequence is a chain complex
FORMULA , with terms the finitely generated FORMULA -modules
FORMULA  and differentials
that can be written in terms of the co-multiplication in FORMULA 
and the induced homomorphism FORMULA .
The homology jump loci of FORMULA  are the
subsets FORMULA  of the maximal spectrum FORMULA 
consisting of those maximal ideals FORMULA  for which the
FORMULA -vector space FORMULA  has dimension
at least FORMULA .
To understand these sets in a more geometric fashion,
consider the projection FORMULA 
onto the maximal free-abelian quotient of FORMULA .
Then, as we show in Lemma REF ,
the set FORMULA  may be identified
with FORMULA . Thus, we may view the
sets FORMULA  as subvarieties of the
FORMULA -vector space FORMULA .
The above definition of homology jump loci works for arbitrary
chain complexes FORMULA  over a finitely generated FORMULA -algebra FORMULA .
In the case when FORMULA  is the cellular chain complex of the
universal abelian cover FORMULA , with coefficients in FORMULA ,
and FORMULA , the corresponding jump loci
(also known as the characteristic varieties of FORMULA )
are Zariski closed subsets of the character group
FORMULA . These sets, which were
introduced by Green and Lazarsfeld in {{cite:65ddb90f-78cf-44c7-84f9-685a97b1debd}}, are
extremely useful in a variety of settings, see for
instance {{cite:60a861c6-5319-4b8c-8c43-36b03538a4e8}}, {{cite:34f1e07b-3c3b-4e12-b127-8cf5e500cd70}}, {{cite:5bcb67b8-3a47-47e5-a700-a7a868e1b897}}, {{cite:31af53c0-0b84-4e61-8f43-be05cd817cf2}}, {{cite:13d7831c-e875-4d8e-99fd-d55532885d80}}.

Resonance varieties
To state our main result, we need to recall one more concept.
Using the cohomology algebra FORMULA  as input, we define
the resonance varieties of FORMULA  as the sets FORMULA 
consisting of those square-zero elements FORMULA  for which
the FORMULA -vector space FORMULA  has dimension at least FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is the cochain complex with terms FORMULA  and
differentials given by left-multiplication by FORMULA . As we show
in Corollary REF , it is enough to assume that FORMULA 
has finite FORMULA -skeleton, in order to conclude that the sets
FORMULA  are Zariski closed, for all FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Furthermore, as we show in Theorem REF ,
the resonance varieties of commutative graded algebras
generically vanish. More precisely, if FORMULA  is a connected,
finite-dimensional, graded FORMULA -vector space, and FORMULA 
is the parameter space for all commutative graded algebras
whose underlying graded vector space is FORMULA , then the
subset of those cgas whose resonance varieties
are trivial is a Zariski open subset of FORMULA .

Resonance and the completed Alexander invariants
We are now ready to state our main result, which relates
the resonance varieties of a space to the finiteness properties
of the completed homology groups of its abelian Galois covers.
(Proofs for the two parts of this result will be given in
Theorems REF  and REF , respectively.)
Theorem 1.1 
Let FORMULA  be a connected CW-complex, let FORMULA 
be a homomorphism onto a finitely generated abelian group FORMULA ,
and let FORMULA  be
the homomorphism induced in cohomology by FORMULA .


If FORMULA  is of finite type, and FORMULA  is the first page of the
corresponding equivariant spectral sequence, then
FORMULA ,
for all FORMULA  and FORMULA .



Suppose FORMULA  has finite FORMULA -skeleton for some FORMULA ,
and, for each FORMULA , the
linear subspace FORMULA  intersects the resonance variety
FORMULA  at most at 0. Then, for each FORMULA ,
the completion of FORMULA  with respect to the
FORMULA -adic filtration is finite-dimensional.


As an application, we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 1.2 
If FORMULA  has finite FORMULA -skeleton, and
all the resonance varieties FORMULA  with FORMULA 
vanish or are empty, then the completions of the Alexander
invariants FORMULA  are finite-dimensional FORMULA -vector
spaces, for all FORMULA .

This corollary generalizes Theorem C(2) from {{cite:5bcb67b8-3a47-47e5-a700-a7a868e1b897}},
a result proved in that paper in the case when FORMULA  equals 1
and the coefficient field is  FORMULA

The homology jump loci of a chain complex
In this section we introduce the support varieties and
homology jump loci of a chain complex over a finitely
generated FORMULA -algebra, and study some of their properties.
Maximal spectrum and supports
We start by reviewing some standard notions from commutative
algebra, as they can be found, for instance, in {{cite:213c7052-e58b-47ed-845e-b59924dd5fb3}}.
Fix a ground field FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be a commutative,
finitely generated FORMULA -algebra (also known as an
affine FORMULA -algebra), and let FORMULA  be the
maximal spectrum of FORMULA . This set comes
endowed with the Zariski topology, whereby
a subset FORMULA  is closed if and only if there is an ideal
FORMULA  such that FORMULA  equals
FORMULA ,
the ozero set of the ideal FORMULA .
Now suppose FORMULA  is algebraically closed. Then
FORMULA , for every maximal ideal FORMULA ,
and we have a natural identification
FORMULA 
under which a maximal ideal FORMULA 
corresponds to the FORMULA -algebra morphism
FORMULA .
Denote by FORMULA  the localization of the ring FORMULA 
at the maximal ideal FORMULA . Clearly, the above morphism
FORMULA  factors through a ring morphism
FORMULA .
Given an FORMULA -module FORMULA , denote by FORMULA  its localization
at the maximal ideal FORMULA ; then FORMULA  acquires in a natural
way the structure of an FORMULA -module. Define the support
of FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
If FORMULA  is a finitely generated FORMULA -module, the
support of FORMULA  is a Zariski closed subset of FORMULA , since
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the annihilator FORMULA .

Support loci
Let FORMULA  be a non-negatively graded chain
complex over FORMULA ; in other words, a sequence of FORMULA -modules
FORMULA  and FORMULA -linear maps between them,
FORMULA 
satisfying FORMULA . Evidently, the homology groups of
the chain complex, FORMULA , are again FORMULA -modules.
Definition 2.1 
The support varieties of the FORMULA -chain complex FORMULA  are
the supports of the exterior powers of the homology modules
FORMULA :
FORMULA 

These subsets of FORMULA  are defined for all integers FORMULA  and all
non-negative integers FORMULA ; they are empty if FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Furthermore, for each FORMULA , we have a nested sequence
FORMULA 
It is readily checked that these sets depend
only on the chain-homotopy equivalence class
of the FORMULA -chain complex FORMULA .
Now suppose FORMULA  is a chain complex of finitely
generated FORMULA -modules. Then the sets FORMULA  are
Zariski closed subsets of FORMULA , for all integers FORMULA 
and FORMULA . Indeed, if FORMULA  is a finitely generated FORMULA -module,
then FORMULA  is also finitely generated, and so are all its exterior
powers; thus, the assertion follows from formula (REF ).

Homology jump loci
Let FORMULA  be a chain complex of FORMULA -modules as in (REF ).
From now on, we will assume that the coefficient field FORMULA  is
algebraically closed, to insure that the residue fields FORMULA 
are isomorphic to FORMULA , for all FORMULA .
Definition 2.2 
The homology jump loci of the FORMULA -chain complex FORMULA  are
defined as
FORMULA 

As before, these sets are defined for all integers FORMULA  and all
non-negative integers FORMULA ; they are empty if FORMULA  and FORMULA ;
and, for each FORMULA , they form a nested sequence
FORMULA 
Furthermore, the sets FORMULA  depend
only on the chain-homotopy equivalence class
of FORMULA . Under some mild restrictions on the chain
complex FORMULA , its homology jump loci
are Zariski closed subsets. The next lemma
makes this statement
more precise.
Lemma 2.3 
Suppose FORMULA  is a chain complex of free, finitely
generated FORMULA -modules, and FORMULA  is algebraically closed.
Then the sets FORMULA  are
Zariski closed subsets of FORMULA , for all integers FORMULA 
and FORMULA .

By definition, a maximal ideal FORMULA 
belongs to the set FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Hence, FORMULA  is the zero-set of the ideal generated
by all minors of size FORMULA  of the block-matrix
FORMULA .
As the next example indicates, the freeness assumption
from Lemma REF  is crucial for the conclusion to hold,
even in the presence of the finite-generation assumption.
We refer to {{cite:fd14e796-3212-4ac4-831c-25d7d09aea15}} for other, more
exotic examples, where both the freeness and the finite-generation
assumptions are violated.
Example 2.4 
Let FORMULA  be an algebraically closed field, and
let FORMULA . Consider the chain complex
of (finitely-generated) FORMULA -modules
FORMULA ,
where FORMULA ,
viewed as a trivial FORMULA -module, and
FORMULA  is the FORMULA -algebra map
given by FORMULA . It is readily verified that
FORMULA , which, of course,
is not a Zariski closed subset of FORMULA .


Comparing the two sets of loci
We are particularly interested in the sets
FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
The next theorem (which, as we shall see in
§REF , generalizes a result from {{cite:34f1e07b-3c3b-4e12-b127-8cf5e500cd70}}),
establishes a comparison between these two types of sets.
Theorem 2.5 
Let FORMULA  be a finitely generated algebra over an algebraically
closed field FORMULA , and
let FORMULA  be a chain complex of free, finitely generated
FORMULA -modules. Then, for all integers FORMULA ,
FORMULA 

If FORMULA , we have
FORMULA .
The case FORMULA  is done by induction on FORMULA , starting at FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be a maximal ideal in FORMULA , and let
FORMULA  be the corresponding FORMULA -algebra morphism.
Consider the Künneth spectral sequence associated to the
free chain complex FORMULA  and the change-of-rings
map FORMULA :
FORMULA 
First suppose FORMULA . Then,
for each FORMULA , we have FORMULA , and so
FORMULA , and thus FORMULA .
Consequently, FORMULA , for all FORMULA ,
which means that
FORMULA .
Now suppose FORMULA .
We may assume FORMULA ,
for all FORMULA , and FORMULA , for
otherwise we'd be done, by the induction hypothesis.
These assumptions mean that FORMULA , for FORMULA ,
and FORMULA .
In particular, we have FORMULA , for FORMULA , and thus
FORMULA . Hence,
FORMULA 
By assumption, FORMULA  is a finitely generated FORMULA -module;
thus, FORMULA  is also finitely generated. Hence,
FORMULA  is a non-zero, finitely generated FORMULA -module.
By Nakayama's Lemma, the module FORMULA 
is also non-zero. Using (REF ), we conclude that
FORMULA , and this completes the proof.
Note that the freeness assumption is again crucial for this
theorem to hold. For instance, if FORMULA  is the chain complex from
Example REF , then FORMULA ,
whereas FORMULA .

The resonance varieties of a graded algebra
We now turn to the resonance varieties associated to a
commutative graded algebra, and set up a parameter
space where these varieties generically vanish.
Resonance varieties
Let FORMULA  be a commutative graded algebra over a field FORMULA ,
for short, a cga. We will assume throughout that FORMULA  is
connected, i.e., FORMULA .
Let FORMULA , and assume FORMULA  (this condition
is redundant if FORMULA , by graded-commutativity
of the multiplication in FORMULA ).
The Aomoto complex of FORMULA  (with respect to FORMULA )
is the cochain complex of FORMULA -vector spaces,
FORMULA 
with differentials given by FORMULA , for FORMULA .
We define the resonance varieties of FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
It follows at once from the definition that
FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
since FORMULA  is connected.
Lemma 3.1 
Suppose FORMULA  is locally finite, i.e., FORMULA , for all FORMULA .
Then the sets FORMULA  are Zariski closed cones inside the
affine space FORMULA .

Let FORMULA ; clearly, FORMULA  is a
Zariski closed cone in FORMULA .
By definition, an element FORMULA  belongs to
the set FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA ,
where FORMULA .
An argument as in Lemma REF  now shows that
FORMULA  is a Zariski closed subset of FORMULA .
Clearly, FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA ,
for all FORMULA ; thus, FORMULA  is a
cone in FORMULA .

A parameter space for graded algebras
Let
FORMULA  be a graded FORMULA -vector
space, with FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Given these data, we define
a parameter space for all commutative graded algebras
whose underlying graded vector space is FORMULA , as follows:
FORMULA 
It is readily seen that FORMULA  is an affine cone in the vector space
FORMULA 
cut out by homogeneous quadrics (corresponding to the associativity
conditions for a cga), and linear equations (corresponding to
graded-commutativity conditions for a cga).
Example 3.2 
Suppose FORMULA . In that case, a
commutative graded algebra
FORMULA  corresponds to an anti-symmetric FORMULA -linear map
FORMULA . Thus, FORMULA 
is an affine space; in fact,
FORMULA  if FORMULA .


Vanishing resonance
We are now ready to state and prove the main result of
this section.
Theorem 3.3 
Let FORMULA  be a connected, finite-dimensional, graded vector space over
an algebraically closed field FORMULA . For each FORMULA , let
FORMULA 
be the set of commutative graded algebras whose underlying
graded vector space is FORMULA  and whose degree FORMULA 
resonance varieties are trivial. Then FORMULA  is
a Zariski open subset of FORMULA .

We need to show that, for each FORMULA , the set
FORMULA 
is Zariski closed.
To that end, consider the set
FORMULA 
A look at the proof of Lemma REF 
shows that this set is defined by bi-homogeneous
equations. In particular, the same equations define a
Zariski closed subset FORMULA  inside FORMULA .
Now consider the first-coordinate projection map
FORMULA . Since FORMULA 
is a complete variety, FORMULA  is a closed
map. On the other hand, FORMULA ,
and this completes the proof.
Remark 3.4 
In {{cite:57119c01-ee3d-4e44-a9fb-b58501ba091e}}, we study a related question, albeit from
a different point of view. Namely, we consider all connected,
finite-dimensional cgas FORMULA  over the field FORMULA A=A1 A2FORMULA A1FORMULA (A1A1A2)FORMULA {A R11(A){0}} FORMULA
The characteristic and resonance varieties of a CW-complex
In this section, we present a topological context in which the
support varieties, homology jump loci, and resonance varieties
arise, and reduce their computation to the case of finite CW-complexes.
Homology with twisted coefficients
Let FORMULA  be a connected CW-complex.
Without loss of generality, we may assume FORMULA  has a single
0-cell, call it FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the fundamental
group of FORMULA , based at FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the universal cover of our CW-complex.
The cell structure on FORMULA  lifts to a cell structure on FORMULA .
Fixing a lift FORMULA  identifies
the fundamental group of FORMULA  with the
group of deck transformations of FORMULA , which
permute the cells. Therefore, we may view the
cellular cell complex FORMULA ,
with differential FORMULA , as a chain complex
of free left modules over the group ring FORMULA .
Given a right FORMULA -module FORMULA , consider the chain complex
FORMULA ,
with differential FORMULA .
The homology groups of FORMULA  with coefficients
in FORMULA  are then defined as FORMULA .
Noteworthy is the following situation.
Let FORMULA  be the universal abelian cover of FORMULA ,
with group of deck transformations FORMULA .
The cellular chain complex FORMULA  is
a chain complex of free modules over the commutative
ring FORMULA . The homology groups
FORMULA 
are FORMULA -modules, called the
Alexander invariants of FORMULA .

Homology jump loci
Fix a field FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be the group
of characters of FORMULA , with values in the multiplicative group of
units of FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is an abelian group, every
character factors through the abelianization FORMULA , and so
we may identify FORMULA  with FORMULA .
Given a homomorphism
FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the rank 1
local system on FORMULA  defined by FORMULA , and let FORMULA 
be the resulting twisted homology groups.
There are three types of (co)homology jumping loci traditionally
associated to a CW-complex FORMULA  as above. First, the
characteristic varieties of FORMULA  (with coefficients in FORMULA )
are the sets
FORMULA 
Second, the Alexander varieties of FORMULA  (with coefficients
in FORMULA ) are the supports of the exterior powers of the
Alexander invariants of FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
And finally, the resonance varieties of FORMULA  (with coefficients
in FORMULA ) are the jumping loci associated to the cohomology
algebra FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
In absolute generality, there is not much structure on these sets.
To remedy this situation, we need to impose some finiteness
restrictions on FORMULA  in order to be able to say more about its jump loci.
To start with, let us assume that FORMULA  has finite 1-skeleton,
and FORMULA  is algebraically closed. Then the fundamental group
FORMULA  is finitely generated, and the character group
FORMULA  is an affine algebraic group, with coordinate
ring the group algebra of the abelianization, FORMULA .
Every character FORMULA  extends
FORMULA -linearly to a ring morphism, FORMULA ,
and thus gives rise to a maximal ideal FORMULA  of FORMULA .
Conversely, since FORMULA  is algebraically closed, each maximal
ideal FORMULA  determines a character
FORMULA . Thus,
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be the equivariant
chain complex of the universal abelian cover, with coefficients in FORMULA .
It is clear from the definitions that
FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Now suppose that FORMULA  has finite FORMULA -skeleton,
for some FORMULA . Then, for each FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
the sets FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are Zariski closed subsets of the character group
FORMULA , either by definition, for the former,
or by Lemma REF , for the latter. Likewise,
the sets FORMULA  are Zariski closed subsets
of the affine space FORMULA , by Lemma REF .
In fact, as we shall see next, these statements also hold for FORMULA .

Reducing to the finite-dimensional case
For the purpose of computing resonance varieties or
homology with certain twisted coefficients, in the
finiteness range of FORMULA , the following proposition allows
us to replace FORMULA  by a finite CW-complex.
Proposition 4.1 
Let FORMULA  be a connected CW-complex with finite FORMULA -skeleton,
for some FORMULA . There exists then a finite CW-complex FORMULA 
of dimension at most FORMULA , with FORMULA , and a map
FORMULA  such that the following hold.

 The induced homomorphism,
FORMULA , is an isomorphism.

 For every commutative ring FORMULA ,
and for every homomorphism FORMULA ,
the induced homomorphism,
FORMULA ,
is an FORMULA -module isomorphism, for all FORMULA .

 The isomorphism FORMULA 
restricts to isomorphisms FORMULA ,
for all FORMULA .

 The isomorphism FORMULA 
restricts to isomorphisms FORMULA ,
for all FORMULA .

 The isomorphism FORMULA 
restricts to isomorphisms FORMULA ,
for all FORMULA .


The cellular chain complex FORMULA 
is a chain complex of free modules over the (commutative)
Noetherian ring FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is
finitely generated as an FORMULA -module, the FORMULA -submodule
FORMULA  is also finitely
generated, let's say, by the images of the FORMULA -cells
FORMULA . Set
FORMULA 
Clearly, FORMULA  is a finite subcomplex of FORMULA ;
let FORMULA  be the inclusion map.
Consider the cup-product map,
FORMULA .
Passing to FORMULA -duals, we obtain the comultiplication map,
FORMULA .
The dual of FORMULA  may be identified with FORMULA .
Proceeding in the same fashion with the space FORMULA , and
comparing the resulting maps via the induced homomorphism
FORMULA , we obtain the following
commuting diagram:
FORMULA 
In general, the vertical arrow in the center of the above
diagram is not surjective. So pick a (finite) FORMULA -basis,
FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
lift those homology classes back to
FORMULA ,
and represent the cycles FORMULA  as FORMULA -linear
combinations of finitely many FORMULA -cells of FORMULA , say,
FORMULA . Then, the CW-complex
FORMULA 
is again a finite subcomplex of FORMULA ; let FORMULA 
be the inclusion map. Redrawing diagram (REF )
with FORMULA  replaced by FORMULA , FORMULA  by FORMULA , etc, we see
that the middle arrow is now surjective. Hence, the
dual map, FORMULA ,
is injective.
Clearly, FORMULA  is an isomorphism,
thus proving part (REF ), and showing that the maps FORMULA 
in parts (REF )–(REF ) are also isomorphisms.
By construction, the map FORMULA 
from part (REF )
is an FORMULA -isomorphism, for all FORMULA , since
FORMULA  corresponds to a change-of-rings map, FORMULA .
Furthermore, parts (REF ) and (REF ) are
now a direct consequence of part (REF ).
Also by construction, the map FORMULA 
restricts to isomorphisms FORMULA ,
for all FORMULA  and all FORMULA . This finishes the proof of part (REF ).
The following corollary is now immediate.
Corollary 4.2 
Let FORMULA  be a connected CW-complex with finite FORMULA -skeleton,
for some FORMULA . Then, for each FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
the sets FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are subvarieties of the character group
FORMULA , while
the sets FORMULA  are subvarieties
of the affine space FORMULA .

Using Theorem REF  and Proposition REF ,
we obtain the following result, which recovers Corollary 3.7
from {{cite:34f1e07b-3c3b-4e12-b127-8cf5e500cd70}}.
Corollary 4.3 
Let FORMULA  be a connected CW-complex with finite FORMULA -skeleton,
for some FORMULA . Then, for all integers FORMULA ,
FORMULA 


The equivariant spectral sequence
We now relate the homology jump loci associated
to the first page of the equivariant spectral sequence of
a space to the resonance varieties of its cohomology
algebra.
The spectrum of the associated graded ring of a group ring
Let FORMULA  be a finitely generated abelian group, and let
FORMULA  be the group-ring over an algebraically closed field FORMULA .
The powers of the augmentation ideal,
FORMULA , define
a descending filtration on FORMULA . The associated
graded ring, FORMULA , is an affine FORMULA -algebra,
whose maximal spectrum we denote by FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the maximal torsion-free
quotient of FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be the augmentation ideal
of FORMULA . The associated graded ring,
FORMULA , may be identified
with the polynomial ring FORMULA , where FORMULA .
Consequently, FORMULA  may be identified with
the affine space FORMULA .
The natural projection FORMULA  extends to a
ring epimorphism FORMULA . In general, this
morphism is not injective. For instance, if FORMULA  and
FORMULA , then FORMULA ,
and thus FORMULA , whereas FORMULA .
Passing to maximal spectra, though, fixes this fat point issue.
Lemma 5.1 
Suppose FORMULA  is algebraically closed. Then, the
morphism FORMULA  induces an isomorphism
FORMULA .

First suppose that FORMULA , and that the
morphisms FORMULA  induce isomorphisms
FORMULA , for FORMULA , 2.
We claim that FORMULA 
is then an isomorphism.
To prove this claim, recall that the group-ring of a direct product of groups
is canonically isomorphic to the tensor product of the group-rings
of the factors. Thus, we have an isomorphism of FORMULA -algebras,
FORMULA .
Now let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be the respective
augmentation ideals. A standard inductive argument shows that
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . Hence, the map FORMULA 
induces an isomorphism of graded FORMULA -algebras,
FORMULA .
Applying the same argument to the decomposition
FORMULA , we obtain
an isomorphism
FORMULA  which fits into the commuting diagram
on the left side of (REF ),
FORMULA 
Applying the functor FORMULA 
to this diagram, we obtain the commuting diagram on the
right side of (REF ). Now, the left-hand arrow
in this diagram is an isomorphism, by our hypothesis.
Thus, the right-hand arrow is also an isomorphism,
and our claim is proved.
Returning now to the proof of the lemma,
it is enough to consider the case when FORMULA  is an elementary
cyclic group. If FORMULA , the lemma is tautologically true, so
we may assume that FORMULA , for some prime FORMULA 
and integer FORMULA . In this case, FORMULA , and so
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
If FORMULA , then FORMULA 
vanishes, and thus FORMULA . If FORMULA , then
FORMULA , and thus FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is given by FORMULA .
In either case, the desired conclusion holds, and we are done.

The first page of the equivariant spectral sequence
Let FORMULA  be a connected, finite-type CW-complex,
and fix a coefficient field FORMULA . As before, let FORMULA  be
the cup product map in FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be the
co-multiplication map in FORMULA .
Next, let FORMULA  be an epimorphism from the
fundamental group FORMULA  to an abelian group FORMULA 
(necessarily, FORMULA  must be finitely generated). Let FORMULA  be
the group-ring of FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be the completion
of this ring with respect to the filtration by powers of the augmentation
ideal. Composing the completion map FORMULA 
with the extension of FORMULA  to group rings yields a ring morphism,
FORMULA . Clearly, this morphism
makes the completion FORMULA  into a module
over FORMULA .
Following the setup from {{cite:a552b272-e0e6-460a-b421-95b0fc1132ad}}, let
FORMULA 
be the first page of the equivariant spectral sequence of FORMULA 
with coefficients in FORMULA . This is a chain complex
of free, finitely-generated modules over the
affine algebra FORMULA . The FORMULA -th term of this chain complex
is
FORMULA 
while the FORMULA -th differential,
FORMULA , when restricted to the generating set
FORMULA , is the composite
FORMULA 
By definition, the transpose of FORMULA  is the cup-product map
FORMULA . Thus, the transpose of FORMULA  is the composite
FORMULA 

Homology jump loci and resonance varieties
Now assume FORMULA  is algebraically closed.
By Lemma REF , we may identify the maximal
spectrum FORMULA  with FORMULA , where
recall FORMULA  is the maximal torsion-free quotient of FORMULA .
Using this identification, we may view the homology jump loci
FORMULA  of the chain complex FORMULA  from (REF )
as subsets of the FORMULA -vector space FORMULA .
The next result compares these loci with the
resonance varieties of FORMULA , viewed as subsets
of FORMULA .
Theorem 5.2 
Let FORMULA  be an epimorphism
onto an abelian group,
and set FORMULA .
Let FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 

By definition, an element FORMULA 
belongs to FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
where recall FORMULA 
is left-multiplication by FORMULA .
Now let FORMULA .
Clearly, FORMULA , and thus FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the
FORMULA -algebra morphism defined by FORMULA .
Denote by FORMULA  the specialization of FORMULA  at FORMULA .
Using sequence (REF ), we find that
FORMULA 
Therefore,
FORMULA 

and this completes the proof.
Remark 5.3 
Noteworthy is the situation when FORMULA  is torsion-free
and FORMULA  is the abelianization map, FORMULA ,
in which case FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the first page of the corresponding spectral
sequence. Applying Theorem REF , we may
then identify FORMULA  with FORMULA .

Remark 5.4 
It would be interesting to find a similar interpretation for the
homology jumping loci of the other pages in the equivariant
spectral sequence. Such an interpretation would likely
involve the higher-order Massey products in FORMULA .


Jump loci and finiteness properties
In this section, we relate the vanishing of the resonance
varieties of a space to the finiteness properties of its
completed Alexander-type invariants. First, we need
to recall a well-known fact from commutative algebra.
For the reader's convenience, we give a sketch of a proof
(see also {{cite:13d7831c-e875-4d8e-99fd-d55532885d80}}).
Lemma 6.1 
Let FORMULA  be an algebraically closed field, and
let FORMULA  be a finitely generated module over an affine
FORMULA -algebra FORMULA . Then:
FORMULA 

The module FORMULA  is finite-dimensional over FORMULA 
if and only if FORMULA  has finite length. This condition
is equivalent to FORMULA  having 0 Krull
dimension, i.e., FORMULA . In turn, this
means that the support of FORMULA  is 0-dimensional,
i.e., FORMULA  is finite.
Now let FORMULA  be a connected CW-complex
with finite FORMULA -skeleton, for some FORMULA .
Given an epimorphism FORMULA  from
FORMULA  to a (finitely generated) abelian
group FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the
projection onto the maximal free-abelian quotient of FORMULA ,
and set FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be the group-ring of FORMULA , with coefficients in an
algebraically closed field FORMULA , let FORMULA  be its augmentation
ideal, and let FORMULA  be the FORMULA -adic completion
of FORMULA . As shown in Lemma REF , the associated
graded ring FORMULA  is an affine FORMULA -algebra,
whose maximal spectrum FORMULA  may be identified
with FORMULA .
Theorem 6.2 
Let FORMULA  be the Galois cover associated to an
epimorphism FORMULA , and let FORMULA 
be the FORMULA -adic completion of the FORMULA -module
FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 

By Proposition REF , we may assume FORMULA  is
a finite complex.
We use the equivariant spectral sequence FORMULA 
associated to the Galois cover FORMULA  corresponding to
the epimorphism FORMULA , with coefficients given by
the ring morphism FORMULA .
The first page of the spectral sequence is FORMULA ,
a chain complex of free, finitely generated FORMULA -modules,
with FORMULA . We then have:
FORMULA 
Using our assumption and the injectivity of FORMULA ,
we conclude that the support of FORMULA 
is the set FORMULA . Hence, by Lemma REF ,
the FORMULA -vector space FORMULA  is
finite-dimensional. It follows that FORMULA 
is also finite-dimensional.
On the other hand, as shown in {{cite:a552b272-e0e6-460a-b421-95b0fc1132ad}}, the equivariant
spectral sequence converges to FORMULA ,
and the spectral sequence filtration on the limit is separated.
The desired conclusion readily follows.
Corollary 6.3 
If FORMULA  for FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
for FORMULA .

In the particular case when FORMULA  and FORMULA 1FORMULA XFORMULA 1FORMULA H1(Xab,FORMULA R11(X,{0}FORMULA In general, though, the converse to Corollary REF 
does not hold. For instance, if FORMULA  is the Heisenberg
3-dimensional nilmanifold, then the cup-product vanishes
on FORMULA , and so FORMULA .
On the other hand, FORMULA , and thus
FORMULA It should also be pointed out that it is really necessary
to take the completion of the Alexander invariant in
Corollary REF , even when FORMULA  is formal.
For instance, if FORMULA  is the presentation 2-complex for
the group FORMULA 
from {{cite:34f1e07b-3c3b-4e12-b127-8cf5e500cd70}},
we have that FORMULA , yet
 FORMULA
