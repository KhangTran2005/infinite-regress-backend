Anomalous monopole of disk shape is found to exist in the semiclassical theory
of a two-mode interacting boson system. The quantum origin of this anomaly
is the collapsing or bundling of field lines of Berry curvature caused by
the interaction between bosons in the semiclassical
limit. The significance of this anomalous monopole
is twofold: (1) it signals the failure of the von Neumann-Wigner theorem
in the semiclassical limit; (2) it indicates a breakdown of
the correspondence principle between quantum and classical dynamics.

Magnetic monopole was first discussed by Dirac as a
quantization condition for electric charge{{cite:6b1510f2-5621-4f5c-9e4a-cbc94e0caf6c}}.
Although it has never been observed in experiment as an
fundamental particle, the monopole has fascinated physicists
ever since{{cite:e8d20963-05ff-4cec-b9f4-d34cc7ffa211}}.
Interestingly, monopoles have attracted great attention
in a very different context as degeneracies or diabolical
points of energy levels in parameter
space{{cite:6074ca9f-2a5a-45bd-a716-0476fb7c041b}}, {{cite:9e8f8a0c-3eca-4f4b-b646-9589973b4003}}, {{cite:9c79a075-4955-43c6-8c1d-6bc4886bdce4}}.
The examples include the degeneracy of Bloch bands in the Brillouin
zone{{cite:5823af59-ece7-4aca-8cea-10f9913f1dab}} and energy levels in molecular
magnets{{cite:b0dc3b0e-fd82-4e2d-ac70-d614bdf0ed18}}, {{cite:95d3018b-749b-47c6-ae74-f3b70ae5184d}}.
The monopoles in this context are found to be crucial to
understanding these systems.
In this work we study a two-mode interacting boson system that depends
on three external parameters. For simplicity, we focus
on its ground state, which is doubly degenerate at one isolated point
in the parameter space. We find that the field lines of
Berry curvature emanating from the point are curved due to
the interaction between bosons. Moreover, at large FORMULA  limit,
that is, when the number of bosons FORMULA  increases to infinity,
the field lines collapse and bundle into a two-dimensional disk
whose radius is determined by the interaction strength.
At large FORMULA  limit, this boson system can be well described
by a mean-field theory{{cite:bcac0e17-72c5-4909-993a-30a62b7f8435}}, {{cite:add80281-0202-4d3b-a15a-abc63f39cfd0}}.
Since this boson system belongs to a class of quantum systems
which become classical at large FORMULA  limit{{cite:cb442caa-5d46-43d2-8006-51085324f5a0}},
this mean-field can be regarded as a semiclassical theory.
We discover that the semiclassical (or mean-field) ground state
of this boson system is degenerate at every point on the
two-dimensional disk mentioned above. This means that the
whole disk is a monopole. This is in stark contrast with what
is demanded by the von Neumann-Wigner theorem{{cite:21fd8f65-5b62-40c1-8f86-87c4a22b0adf}}:
the monopole in a three-dimensional parameter space is always a
point-like object. Therefore, this anomalous monopole of disk shape
indicates that the von Neumann-Wigner theorem fails in the semiclassical
limit. Our further analysis shows that the magnetic charge
is not uniformly distributed in the disk while its total charge is
still FORMULA , the Chern number{{cite:9c79a075-4955-43c6-8c1d-6bc4886bdce4}}.
In addition, this anomalous monopole is compared to an
anomalous monopole that is formed in a trivial fashion.
The Berry curvatures are computed for this system within
the semiclassical theory and compared to the results in
the quantum description. The matching becomes better
as FORMULA  increases as expected from the correspondence principle
between quantum and classical dynamics{{cite:bc3b03d3-a4aa-4ce4-b5c3-d7f6eda8ce48}}.
However, on the monopole disk, the Berry curvature differs
significantly between its semiclassical result and quantum
result even in the large FORMULA  limit. This shows that
the existence of the anomalous monopole
indicates a breakdown of the correspondence principle.
This breakdown is analyzed from a fresh perspective by regarding the
three external parameters as the dynamical variables
of a massive classical particle.
The two-mode interacting boson system is described by
the following second quantized Hamiltonian
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA 
are bosonic operators for two different quantum states,
respectively, FORMULA  is the interacting strength between
bosons, and FORMULA  is the volume of the system.
The three parameters, FORMULA ,FORMULA , and FORMULA , characterize the
influence from environment or another system. This Hamiltonian
has its root in modeling the Bose-Einstein condensates in a
double-well potential{{cite:add80281-0202-4d3b-a15a-abc63f39cfd0}}. It also belongs to
a class of Hamiltonians studied in Refs.{{cite:b0dc3b0e-fd82-4e2d-ac70-d614bdf0ed18}}, {{cite:95d3018b-749b-47c6-ae74-f3b70ae5184d}}
for single molecule magnet if we introduce
FORMULA ,
FORMULA ,
and FORMULA .
The focus of studies in Refs.{{cite:b0dc3b0e-fd82-4e2d-ac70-d614bdf0ed18}}, {{cite:95d3018b-749b-47c6-ae74-f3b70ae5184d}} is
on the pattern and topological property of the monopoles.
In this work we examine the “magnetic” fields, i.e.,
Berry curvatures, generated by the monopoles and
their behavior in the semiclassical limit FORMULA .
Note that large FORMULA  limit
is always taken by keeping FORMULA  constant.
For simplicity, we concentrate on the ground state of this system.
At point FORMULA , we have FORMULA , whose
ground state is either FORMULA 
or FORMULA . This means
that the ground state of this boson system is doubly degenerate
at point FORMULA . The ground state
is not degenerate elsewhere in the parameter space.
FIGURE 
This degenerate point or monopole at FORMULA  generates “magnetic”
field FORMULA  (Berry curvature) in the parameter
space spanned by FORMULA . As one usually uses field lines to illustrate
a magnetic field, we have computed numerically the field lines of Berry
curvature and plotted them in Fig.REF (a). For clarity, only
the results for FORMULA  and FORMULA  are plotted. Nevertheless an
interesting trend is clearly demonstrated: the field lines
are curved towards a disk defined by FORMULA 
and FORMULA ; the curving gets stronger as FORMULA  increases. In fact,
our numerical results show that the field lines will collapse
and bundle (or converge) into the disk when FORMULA  approaches infinity.
As we know, a magnetic monopole (or an electric charge) can be
viewed as the converging point or the emitting source of
field lines. This collapsing (or converging) of field lines
suggests that the whole disk become a monopole in the limit
FORMULA . This is indeed the case as we shall show.
At large FORMULA  limit, this boson system becomes “classical” and can
be described by the following mean-field (or semiclassical)
Hamiltonian{{cite:bcac0e17-72c5-4909-993a-30a62b7f8435}}, {{cite:add80281-0202-4d3b-a15a-abc63f39cfd0}},
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are complex amplitudes for the system in
the two quantum modes. The normalization is one, i.e.,
FORMULA . This kind of nonlinear Hamiltonian also
appears in photoassociation systems{{cite:091a78a1-8065-41e0-ad44-ac48b06744d2}}, {{cite:8749210e-458a-4813-9411-a116cbbc6145}}.
Within this semiclassical description, the ground state of this
system is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the solution of the following equation,
FORMULA 
This equation has one real root when FORMULA .
When FORMULA , it can have three real roots. In
particular, when FORMULA , two of the three real roots given by
FORMULA  have the same energy
and are for the ground states. This means that in the semiclassical
description of the system, the ground state is degenerate on
the disk given by FORMULA  and FORMULA . In other
words, the whole disk is a monopole(see Fig.REF ).
FIGURE 
This anomalous disk-shaped monopole is very surprising.
According to the von Neumann-Wigner theorem, the
accidental degeneracy of a quantum system occurs only at isolated
points in a three dimensional parameter space{{cite:21fd8f65-5b62-40c1-8f86-87c4a22b0adf}}.
In other words, the monopole must be a point. This is indeed
the case when our system is described by the second-quantized
Hamiltonian: the ground state is degenerate
only at point FORMULA  as we have already pointed out.
However, in the semiclassical description,
that is, at large FORMULA  limit, the monopole is a two-dimensional
disk as the result of the curving and collapsing of field lines.
This shows by example that the von Neumann-Wigner theorem does not hold
in the semiclassical limit.
The significance of this anomalous monopole can be appreciated
from a different angle. We consider the highest eigenstate
of this system. For this eigenstate, its semiclassical monopole is
a line as shown in Fig.REF . However, this line-shaped
monopole which appears also anomalous is trivial, not as significant as
the disk-shaped monopole. The reason is as follows. In the second
quantized model, the highest eigenstate has FORMULA  equally spaced degenerate
points along FORMULA  axis between FORMULA  and FORMULA . As FORMULA  approaches infinity,
these degenerate points merge into a line, forming
in a trivial fashion the one dimensional monopole.
Let us now examine this disk-shaped anomalous monopole in detail.
Although the semiclassical Hamiltonian FORMULA  is nonlinear,
the Berry curvature FORMULA  of this monopole can
be computed as in a linear system{{cite:1a9b047c-b2e4-40db-849c-a607c0a5f24a}}. That is
to compute the curl of the vector potential
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  given in Eq.(REF ).
The Berry curvature FORMULA  is found to be
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  is the unit vector for
FORMULA  direction. This result
is plotted as field lines in Fig.REF (b). It is
apparent that these semiclassical field lines away from
the monopole disk are very similar to the field lines
obtained with the second quantized model. Note that
FORMULA  has two different values on the monopole disk
due to the double degeneracy of the ground state.
By integrating FORMULA  over a closed surface
around a small area in the disk, we find that the “magnetic”
charge is not uniformly distributed over the disk. The charge
distribution is
FORMULA 
The integration of this charge density over the whole disk
gives us a Chern number of FORMULA . So, although the monopole has
changed from a point to a disk as the semiclassical limit is
approached, the total charge does not change. It is worthwhile to
mention that the total charge of the line-shaped monopole is infinite
as easily inferred from its trivial origin.
Berry{{cite:bc3b03d3-a4aa-4ce4-b5c3-d7f6eda8ce48}} once established a semiclassical relation
between Berry phase{{cite:9e8f8a0c-3eca-4f4b-b646-9589973b4003}} and Hannay's
angle{{cite:317bf974-98c9-4dcd-82bf-d1b80b6c02f5}}, {{cite:ec42346a-67cc-4fbc-9a0c-9f82df68298f}}
in accordance with the correspondence principle.
This semiclassical relation basically says that the two-forms
for Berry phase and Hannay's angle (the two-form for Berry
phase is the usual Berry curvature) are the same in the semiclassical
limit FORMULA . This semiclassical relation should
hold in this interacting boson system. We
define two pairs of conjugate variables,
FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA , FORMULA  for the
semiclassical Hamiltonian{{cite:1c281710-6c88-4b47-9abe-8734b12ed174}}. The quantization is
realized with the following commutators,
FORMULA 
One can obtain the second quantized Hamiltonian(REF )
with the following substitution FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and
FORMULA , FORMULA .
These commutators show why FORMULA  is
the semiclassical limit. As a result, the semiclassical
relation established by Berry{{cite:bc3b03d3-a4aa-4ce4-b5c3-d7f6eda8ce48}} for this boson system is
FORMULA 
Note that the Hannay's angle in the semiclassical system FORMULA  is
just the Berry phase generalized for nonlinear quantum system
in Ref.{{cite:1a9b047c-b2e4-40db-849c-a607c0a5f24a}} and
the semiclassical Berry curvature FORMULA  is
the two-form for this Hannay's angle.
Our numerical results show that the relation (REF ) indeed
holds almost everywhere in the parameter space except on
the monopole disk. On the disk, the semiclassical Berry curvature
FORMULA  has a non-zero FORMULA  component while the
quantum FORMULA  always points radially in the FORMULA  plane.
Furthermore, the quantum Berry curvature FORMULA  diverges
exponentially with FORMULA  on the
monopole disk while the in-plane component of the semiclassical
FORMULA  does not. We define FORMULA , where
the superscript FORMULA  denotes the component of the vector
parallel to the FORMULA  plane. The difference FORMULA  is plotted
in Fig.REF , where we see the
difference FORMULA  increases exponentially with FORMULA .
This diverging difference shows that the semiclassical relation
in Eq.(REF ) is broken. Therefore, the disk-shaped
monopole also signifies the breakdown of the corresponding
principle between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics.
In the following, we shall look into
this breakdown from a very different angle, showing that
some quantum effect remains in the semiclassical limit.
FIGURE 
We treat the three parameters, FORMULA , as dynamical
variables of a massive and classical particle, whose Hamiltonian
is FORMULA . In this way we obtain a
Born-Oppenheimer type system where a fast quantum system is coupled
to a heavy and slow classical system{{cite:1c281710-6c88-4b47-9abe-8734b12ed174}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a general wavevector for the boson system.
It is reasonable to expect that at the large FORMULA  limit we can simplify
the above Hamiltonian by replacing its first part by the semiclassical
Hamiltonian in Eq.(REF ),
FORMULA 
However, in the following, we shall show that the two Hamiltonians
FORMULA  and FORMULA  do not have the same dynamics even in the limit
FORMULA . That is, there is a difference between
the two Hamiltonians which does not vanish as FORMULA 
increases.
For a Born-Oppenheimer system, it is well known that the
dynamics of the slow system FORMULA  is controlled by two forces,
Born-Oppenheimer force and geometric
force{{cite:1c281710-6c88-4b47-9abe-8734b12ed174}}, {{cite:9b429386-893e-4dc3-a0bb-a218735739f7}}, {{cite:9dde9af7-315a-4970-9cd5-b799221bd242}}. The
Born-Oppenheimer force FORMULA  is the gradient of an eigenenergy of
the fast system. If FORMULA  is
the Berry curvature of the fast system, the dynamics of the slow
system is then given by
FORMULA 
One can use either the second quantized Hamiltonian FORMULA 
or the semiclassical Hamiltonian FORMULA  to compute both forces.
We consider a special case, where the slow classical particle is set with
the initial condition, FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA  while the fast boson system is kept in its ground
state. We set up ourselves to a task to design a potential FORMULA 
so that the slow particle stays in FORMULA  plane and makes a circular motion.
When FORMULA  is large, one would feel safe to design FORMULA  by
using the semiclassical Hamiltonian FORMULA  to
compute FORMULA  and FORMULA .
However, due to the exponential breakdown of Eq.(REF )
discussed above, such designed FORMULA  will not be able to keep
the classical particle in the FORMULA  plane: the strong parallel component
of FORMULA  will kick the particle out of the plane.
This shows that there is always some physical consequence which
can not be counted in the semiclassical theory.
It is interesting
note that Berry and Robbins once pointed out that a kind of friction
in a chaotic classical system does not exist in its corresponding quantum
system and called it discordance{{cite:9dde9af7-315a-4970-9cd5-b799221bd242}}. What
we observe here is similar to this discordance although our system
is not chaotic in the semiclassical limit.
In conclusion, we have found an anomalous monopole of disk shape in
a two-mode interacting boson system. This kind
of anomalous monopole should exit in a general interacting
boson system. For example, if one manages to compute
the Bloch bands of an interacting boson system in a three
dimensional periodic
potential, one should expect such an anomalous monopole
in the Brillouin zone. We have further demonstrated that this
anomalous monopole is an indication of the failure of the
von Neumann-Wigner theorem in the semiclassical limit
and the breakdown of the correspondence principle
between quantum and classical dynamics.
