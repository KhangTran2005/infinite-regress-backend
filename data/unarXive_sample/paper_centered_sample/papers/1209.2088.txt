random graph FORMULA ;
edge FORMULA  for FORMULA  exists independently
with probability FORMULA .
This random graph model is related to certain spreading processes on
networks. We consider the component reachable from
FORMULA  and prove existence of a sharp threshold
FORMULA  at which this reachable component transitions from
FORMULA  to FORMULA .
Introduction
In this note we study a random graph model that captures the
dynamics of a particular type of spreading process.
Consider a set of FORMULA  ordered vertices FORMULA  with vertex FORMULA 
initially `infiltrated' (at time step 1). At time steps
FORMULA , vertex
FORMULA  attempts to independently
infiltrate, with
probability FORMULA , each of FORMULA  in turn (one per step).
Either FORMULA  gets infiltrated or immunized.
If FORMULA  is infected, it attempts to infect FORMULA , also each with probability FORMULA ; FORMULA  does not
attempt to infect FORMULA , however, as prior vertices
are already
either infiltrated or immunized.
At time step FORMULA , all infiltrated
vertices FORMULA  with FORMULA  are attempting to
infiltrate FORMULA , and FORMULA  gets infiltrated if any
one of these attempts
succeeds.
Intuitively, FORMULA  is more likely to get infiltrated if
more vertices are already infiltrated at the time that
FORMULA  becomes 'succeptible'. One example of such a contagion process
is given in {{cite:c4caf7f6-8ebe-403b-868e-1df842c154f0}}.
This spreading
process is equivalent to the following random model of an ordered,
directed graph FORMULA : order the vertices FORMULA , and for
FORMULA , the directed
edge FORMULA  exists in FORMULA 
with probability
FORMULA  (independently). Vertex FORMULA  is infected if there is a (directed) path from
FORMULA  to FORMULA .
The question we address
is, “What is the size of the set of vertices reachable from FORMULA ?”
(the size of
the infection).
We prove the following sharp result.
Theorem 1 
Let FORMULA  be the set of vertices reachable from FORMULA , and suppose FORMULA , where
FORMULA  and FORMULA  is fixed. Then:

If FORMULA , then FORMULA , a.a.s.

If FORMULA , then FORMULA , a.a.s.

If FORMULA , then FORMULA , a.a.s.


Recall that
an event holds a.a.s.(asymptotically almost surely), if it holds with probability FORMULA ; that is it holds with probability
tending to one as FORMULA  tends to infinity. Note that we do not explicitly care whether FORMULA  is positive or negative in the results above.
Similar phase transitions are well known for various graph properties in other random graph models. As shown by Erdős and Rényi in {{cite:c4db5f40-5df0-4e04-a4b4-c07a66f5f6d0}}, in the FORMULA  model of
random graphs, where a graph is chosen independently from all graphs with FORMULA  edges, there is a similar emergence of a component of size FORMULA  around FORMULA  edges.
Likewise, a threshold for connectivity was shown for FORMULA  edges. For the more familiar FORMULA  model, where edges are present
independenty with probability FORMULA , this translates into a threshold
at FORMULA  for a giant component, and at FORMULA  for
connectivity. A much more comprehensive account of results on properties of random graphs can be found in {{cite:38db6d31-1910-443c-8562-fab344a7f20c}}. Łuczak in {{cite:27f7f88c-fed3-468d-9919-22d885565275}} and more recently
Łuczak and Seierstad in {{cite:032a56bd-d0a7-44cd-b9ba-638a89dfbe8d}}, studied the emergence of the giant component in a random directed graphs, in both the directed model where FORMULA  random edges are present and in the model where edges are present with
probability FORMULA . Thresholds for strong connectivity were established for random directed graphs by Palásti {{cite:b0417ec2-00e2-464f-86b7-4394f30199fe}} (for random directed graphs with FORMULA  edges) and Graham and Pike {{cite:94e0917c-af14-4d2d-9a80-2ca97f9f5c08}} (for random directed graphs with edge probability FORMULA ).
We are not aware of any results for ordered directed random graphs where
edges connect vertices of lower index to higher index.

A Proof of Theorem  REF
[Upper bounds:]
For FORMULA ,
let FORMULA  denote the event that FORMULA  is reachable,
and let FORMULA  denote the number of paths to vertex FORMULA  in FORMULA .
If FORMULA  denotes the set of all potential
paths from FORMULA  to FORMULA ,
then FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a FORMULA 
indicator random variable indicating whether the path FORMULA 
exists in FORMULA ;
FORMULA  if and only if all edges in the path FORMULA  are present
in FORMULA .
Then,
FORMULA 

Let FORMULA  denote the number of reachable vertices (other than
FORMULA ).
FORMULA 
For FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
Now consider FORMULA . Let
FORMULA 

Note that by our choice of FORMULA , and the fact that FORMULA , that FORMULA .
Then,
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is increasing in FORMULA ,
the expected number of reachable vertices
FORMULA  with FORMULA  is at most FORMULA .
Applying Markov's inequality,
FORMULA  a.a.s.
Thus,
FORMULA 
For FORMULA  with FORMULA , we will write
FORMULA ,
where FORMULA .
Let FORMULA 
Then,
FORMULA 
To prove the lower bounds, we require a simple lemma similar to
Dirichlet's theorem.
Let FORMULA  denote the number of divisors of FORMULA  and
let FORMULA  denote the number of
divisors of FORMULA  that are at most FORMULA .
Dirichlet's Theorem states that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is Euler's constant. For our purposes,
we need a refinement of this result, summing
FORMULA .
Lemma 1 
 FORMULA

For FORMULA  the result follows from Dirichlet's theorem
as we may replace FORMULA  with FORMULA  in the summation.
For FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the FORMULA -th harmonic number.

[Lower bounds:]
For exposition, assume that we construct our graph on
countably many vertices and that we then restrict our attention
to the first FORMULA  vertices.
Let FORMULA  denote the index of the FORMULA -th reachable vertex (that is
not FORMULA ).
If FORMULA  then FORMULA . Set
FORMULA , and for FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is geometrically
distributed with parameter FORMULA .
Fix FORMULA , and consider FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Each term is an infinite geometric series, and so
FORMULA 
As this series is absolutely summable (as FORMULA  is clearly finite),
Fubini's theorem allows us to rearrange terms in the summation to get
FORMULA 
because the term FORMULA  appears in the original
summation (where FORMULA ) once for every divisor FORMULA  has that is
at most FORMULA .
We now use summation by parts to manipulate the second term:
FORMULA 

Since FORMULA , we have that
FORMULA 
Furthermore, since FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
independent,
FORMULA 

Here, the first
inequality follows from an application of Cauchy-Schwarz, and the second
from
 FORMULA
Now, suppose that FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
and set FORMULA . Then, from (REF ),
FORMULA 

For FORMULA  sufficiently large, FORMULA .
Meanwhile, from FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
because FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Chebyshev's inequality asserts that
FORMULA 
Thus, FORMULA .
Using (REF ),
FORMULA 
i.e., FORMULA  a.a.s. Since FORMULA  implies
FORMULA , we have that
FORMULA  a.a.s.
For FORMULA , take FORMULA . Then,
using (REF ),
FORMULA 
Again, by FORMULA  and because FORMULA ,
FORMULA .
Chebyschev's inequality asserts that
FORMULA 
Hence,
FORMULA 

So, FORMULA  a.a.s.
We now consider the vertices indexed higher than FORMULA  and show
that essentially all of them are reachable.
Let FORMULA  be the vertices with index higher than FORMULA 
which are not adjacent to one of the first FORMULA  reachable
vertices in FORMULA .
Then
FORMULA 

Applying Markov's inequality, FORMULA  with probability FORMULA .
Since the set of vertices indexed above FORMULA  that is not reachable is
a subset of
FORMULA ,
FORMULA . Since
FORMULA  are FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have
that FORMULA  with probability FORMULA ,
as desired.
