Understanding the magnetic excitations in high-transition
temperature (high-FORMULA ) copper oxides is important
because they may mediate the electron pairing for superconductivity
{{cite:e6e6b144-0c22-4dab-b25c-abcf2d88e563}}, {{cite:07f7f2da-4523-4cf4-8b0e-3f1cf6041b5e}}. By determining
the wavevector (Q) and energy (FORMULA )
dependence of the magnetic excitations,
one can calculate the change in the exchange energy available to
the superconducting condensation energy {{cite:2eb03774-ea78-4f0d-8c60-b4bef7440556}}, {{cite:7b928cbc-0fcb-4a41-825b-967df339ce57}}, {{cite:894c3039-3d8c-4f70-bcf4-e50b3c906f7c}}.
For the high-FORMULA  superconductor YBaFORMULA CuFORMULA OFORMULA ,
the most prominent feature in the magnetic excitations is the
resonance {{cite:8d98bf1d-3432-47a7-bb7c-0f36e0e1d275}}, {{cite:4422fc38-d471-49d0-94c0-562bc61852a7}}, {{cite:f6c9d3ef-48f4-4d48-9b99-913851744137}}, {{cite:2c88cfe6-637f-4b29-936e-c4d61304f837}}, {{cite:b15c6274-4e40-4851-be99-40801da33993}}, {{cite:315793cf-b307-4c3e-a5c7-b18e0ee6d2c7}}, {{cite:c3697f65-1368-42c2-9972-f8c0ac64b8c7}}. Although
the resonance has been suggested to contribute a major part of the
superconducting condensation {{cite:7b928cbc-0fcb-4a41-825b-967df339ce57}}, {{cite:c87f3295-c546-4eac-a5e5-e6eedbdfca65}}, the accuracy of
such an estimation has been in doubt because the resonance is only a small portion
of the total magnetic scattering {{cite:c3697f65-1368-42c2-9972-f8c0ac64b8c7}}, {{cite:c87f3295-c546-4eac-a5e5-e6eedbdfca65}}, {{cite:a3d98d7b-5f08-480e-908b-aa704e447aa9}}.
Here we report
an extensive
mapping of magnetic excitations
for YBaFORMULA CuFORMULA OFORMULA  (FORMULA  K).
Using the absolute intensity measurements of
the full spectra, we estimate the change in the magnetic exchange energy between the
normal and superconducting states and find it to be about 15 times larger than the superconducting condensation energy {{cite:7824c017-d2fb-41ff-b06a-530820be04b5}}, {{cite:b82b507b-8f5a-4148-97d4-2972bb1612a4}}.
Our results thus indicate that the change in the magnetic exchange energy
is large enough to provide the driving force for high-FORMULA  superconductivity in YBaFORMULA CuFORMULA OFORMULA .

FIGURE 
If magnetic excitations are mediating electron pairing in the high-FORMULA  copper oxides,
one expects that the change in magnetic exchange energy provides
enough energy for superconducting condensation. The condensation energy
is known experimentally from specific heat measurements for
YBaFORMULA CuFORMULA OFORMULA  (YBCO) to be FORMULA 3 K/formula unit (f.u.) {{cite:7824c017-d2fb-41ff-b06a-530820be04b5}}, {{cite:b82b507b-8f5a-4148-97d4-2972bb1612a4}}.
Within the FORMULA -FORMULA  model the change in magnetic exchange energy can be
calculated from the nearest neighbor spin correlations
{{cite:2eb03774-ea78-4f0d-8c60-b4bef7440556}}, {{cite:7b928cbc-0fcb-4a41-825b-967df339ce57}}, {{cite:894c3039-3d8c-4f70-bcf4-e50b3c906f7c}}:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the exchange interaction, FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the electron spin
operators at nearest neighbor Cu sites FORMULA  and FORMULA  in the CuOFORMULA  plane, respectively.
Instead of estimating the magnetic resonance's contribution to the
superconducting condensation {{cite:7b928cbc-0fcb-4a41-825b-967df339ce57}}, {{cite:c87f3295-c546-4eac-a5e5-e6eedbdfca65}}, we seek here to calculate
FORMULA  from the entire observable magnetic excitation spectrum. In
general, a complete determination of the magnetic excitation spectrum is
difficult as spin fluctuations can spread over a large wavevector and energy
range. YBCO has two CuOFORMULA  planes per unit cell (bilayer) and therefore the
magnetic excitations have odd (acoustic) or even (optical) symmetry with
respect to the neighboring planes (Fig. 1). For optimally doped YBCO, the
magnetic excitation spectrum is dominated by a resonance mode centered at 41
meV in the acoustic channel {{cite:8d98bf1d-3432-47a7-bb7c-0f36e0e1d275}}, {{cite:4422fc38-d471-49d0-94c0-562bc61852a7}}, and a mapping of the acoustic
and optical magnetic excitations should allow an estimation of FORMULA .
FIGURE 
Figure 1 summarizes the key conclusions of our work. The optical
and acoustic spin fluctuations can be separated by their
differences in FORMULA -dependence (Fig. 1b). The total magnetic
response FORMULA  can then be written as
FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  Å is the spacing between the nearest neighbor
CuOFORMULA  planes along the FORMULA -axis. To probe the entire magnetic
spectra in optical and acoustic channels of
YBCO, we used the MAPS spectrometer at ISIS Facility
{{cite:c3697f65-1368-42c2-9972-f8c0ac64b8c7}}, {{cite:a24f2897-56d7-48f4-b981-e93805f4cf4b}} and chose incident beam energies of FORMULA , 40, 62.5, 75, 90, 110, 130, 138, 160, 210, 280, 360, and 450
meV with the incident beam along the FORMULA -axis.
The position sensitive detectors on MAPS allow
a complete determination on the FORMULA -structure of
incommensurate spin fluctuations for YBCO in one
experimental setting {{cite:c3697f65-1368-42c2-9972-f8c0ac64b8c7}}. This avoids the complication of de-convoluting the
instrumental resolution necessary for structure determination of
incommensurate peaks using triple-axis spectroscopy
{{cite:ad58032f-7ed3-4f19-a4dc-46f1fc383e91}}.
The temperatures probed were FORMULA , 100, and 290 K. The
intensity difference between 15 K and 100 K is almost
entirely magnetic because of the small value of FORMULA  probed by the
experiment and small change in the Bose factor for
FORMULA  meV {{cite:2c88cfe6-637f-4b29-936e-c4d61304f837}}, {{cite:b15c6274-4e40-4851-be99-40801da33993}}, {{cite:72e1aa71-3ef1-4894-8740-50b5b69be621}}.
Figures 2(a)-(c) summarize the temperature dependence of the
FORMULA  meV scattering at the position of
optical spin fluctuations (FORMULA  meV). A clear incommensurate
scattering appears at 15 K (Fig. 2(a)) and they are replaced by a
broad response at 100 K (Fig. 2(b)).
Figs. 2(d)-(f) show the
temperature dependence of the scattering around the 41 meV
acoustic resonance obtained by using FORMULA  meV. At FORMULA  K,
the scattering shows a sharp resonance centered at FORMULA 
{{cite:b15c6274-4e40-4851-be99-40801da33993}}. On warming to 100 K, the resonance disappears (Fig.
2(e)). Further warming to 290 K does not change the scattering
significantly (Fig. 2(f)).
FIGURE 
Figure 3 summarizes the optical spin fluctuations for
FORMULA  meV. For FORMULA 
meV, the scattering shows no difference between normal and
superconducting states (Figs. 3(a) and 3(e)). Since there is
little normal state magnetic scattering, there must be an optical
spin gap around 34 meV. On increasing the energy transfer to
FORMULA  meV, where the acoustic channel has a
commensurate resonance, spin fluctuations in the optical channel
form a broad incommensurate structure away from FORMULA  (Fig.
3(b)). Figure 4f confirms the incommensurate nature of the
scattering and shows that the FORMULA  and FORMULA  cut directions
are inequivalent. For FORMULA  meV, again we find
incommensurate peaks but this time the scattering is more box-like
with enhanced corners (Figs. 3(c) and 3(g)). The orientation of
the scattering is rotated 45FORMULA  from that in Fig. 4(b),
similar to acoustic high-energy spin excitations in
YBaFORMULA CuFORMULA OFORMULA  {{cite:c3697f65-1368-42c2-9972-f8c0ac64b8c7}}. Finally, on moving the
energy to FORMULA  meV, the temperature difference
spectrum is featureless. Inspection of the unsubtracted data at 15
K reveals no observable magnetic scattering (Fig. 3(h)).
FIGURE 
Figures 4(a)-(e) show the intensity difference spectra between 15
K and 100 K at various energies in the acoustic channel. For
FORMULA  meV, the temperature difference has
negative intensity, possibly due to a reduction in the magnetic
response on entering the superconducting state {{cite:72e1aa71-3ef1-4894-8740-50b5b69be621}} or
large phonon population at 100 K (Fig. 4a). A cut through the
image confirms no intensity gain at low temperatures (Fig. 4f).
When increasing the energy to FORMULA  meV, the
difference image shows a quartet of incommensurate peaks at
FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA  r.l.u. To demonstrate that the incommensurate scattering is
not circular around FORMULA , we made two cuts
through the image. The cut along the FORMULA  direction clearly
shows two incommensurate peaks around FORMULA . In contrast, a
cut along the FORMULA  direction has no incommensurate peaks. Note that
a circular symmetry at FORMULA  meV has been
suggested for YBCO from previous
triple-axis experiments {{cite:ad58032f-7ed3-4f19-a4dc-46f1fc383e91}}.
Figure 4(c) shows the data at the resonance energy and its
wavevector dependence has a Gaussian lineshape centered around
FORMULA  (Fig. 4(h)). For energies above the resonance
(FORMULA  meV), the scattering is incommensurate
although the low counting rate does not allow an unambiguous
identification of its FORMULA -structure (Figs. 4(d),4(i)).
For FORMULA  meV, the temperature difference spectra as
well as unsubtracted data show no evidence of magnetic scattering
around FORMULA  (Figs. 4(e),4(j)).
Figures 1(e) and 1(f) summarize the superconductivity-induced (15
KFORMULA 100 K) change in the local dynamic susceptibility
FORMULA  in absolute units for optical and
acoustic channels of YBCO, respectively. In the
optical channel, FORMULA  has a peak at
FORMULA  meV, similar to theoretical expectations {{cite:8b67d63b-21f5-444c-b05b-456eea437e90}}. The magnetic spectral weight gradually increases
from above the spin-gap value of FORMULA 30 meV {{cite:b15c6274-4e40-4851-be99-40801da33993}}, peaks
at 46 meV, and finally diminishes for energies above FORMULA 70 meV.
The acoustic channel behaves similarly although it peaks at the
expected resonance position of 40 meV {{cite:b15c6274-4e40-4851-be99-40801da33993}}.
The magnitude of the total spectral weight in the optical channel
FORMULA 
FORMULA  and in the acoustic channel is FORMULA 
FORMULA  per f.u. respectively.
This value is similar to that for
YBaFORMULA CuFORMULA OFORMULA  around the acoustic resonance energy (FORMULA  FORMULA /f.u. for
FORMULA 
meV) {{cite:c3697f65-1368-42c2-9972-f8c0ac64b8c7}}. Since the high-energy
response in underdoped YBaFORMULA CuFORMULA OFORMULA  (FORMULA ) takes
up much more spectral weight than the resonance
{{cite:315793cf-b307-4c3e-a5c7-b18e0ee6d2c7}}, {{cite:c3697f65-1368-42c2-9972-f8c0ac64b8c7}}, it is surprising that there is essentially no
observed magnetic response for energies above 60 meV in
YBCO (Fig. 1f). Compared to undoped
YBaFORMULA CuFORMULA OFORMULA  {{cite:93eb488b-b21b-4dbc-81f2-3a16e9af1299}}, {{cite:140cdb8b-06cd-4cbb-ad65-74c7c8cb9ff2}}, which has a
total integrated moment of FORMULA 0.4 FORMULA /f.u. when
integrated up to 120 meV, the total integrated moment in optimally
doped YBCO has only about 26% of the spectral
weight in the same energy range in the acoustic channel only.
Using the spin excitation spectra in Figs. 3 and 4,
we have calculated the changes in the magnetic excitations from the normal to the superconducting
state and estimated
FORMULA /f.u.,
where FORMULA  is the spin-spin correlation
function for nearest neighbour copper atoms (see supplementary information).
This estimate neglects contributions from energies below 24 meV and
above 70 meV, where
magnetic scattering is difficult to resolve. Also, in Eq. (REF ) the difference
between normal and superconducting state is meant to be determined at the same
temperature, while here we had to take normal state data at 100 K and
superconducting state data at 15 K neglecting a possible temperature
dependence of the normal state magnetic excitations. In order to
assess the error introduced by these neglections, we have fitted an
RPA-BCS model calculation of the spin excitation spectrum {{cite:9bd15cd6-3d14-4454-9560-9339e6718e45}} to our data
and calculated the missing contributions within this model.
This calculation indicates that our value for FORMULA  could
be of order 30 % too large due to these neglections(see supplementary information).
Assuming an exchange coupling of FORMULA  meV, the change in exchange energy
would be FORMULA  meV/f.u.=-24 K/planar Cu. This value is a factor of 1.3 times larger
than the 18 K/Cu estimated from the acoustic resonance alone
in previous work {{cite:7b928cbc-0fcb-4a41-825b-967df339ce57}}. Even if we consider that our estimation may be
too large by 30 %, the change in the exchange energy is still much larger
than the FORMULA  0.26 meV/f.u.= 3 K/f.u. = 1.5 K/planar Cu
condensation energy {{cite:7824c017-d2fb-41ff-b06a-530820be04b5}}, {{cite:b82b507b-8f5a-4148-97d4-2972bb1612a4}}.
Our results reveal two important conclusions for spin
excitations of optimally doped YBCO. First,
the optical resonance reported earlier {{cite:ecfff74f-fbeb-499f-92ae-83f724955dd6}}, {{cite:4a5f48f3-3c64-498e-acf6-2ce210627cd8}}
is actually incommensurate and this naturally explains the large
FORMULA -widths previously reported. Second, our determination of the
dynamical susceptibility in absolute units allows an estimation of
the change of the magnetic excitation energy available
to the superconducting condensation energy
{{cite:7b928cbc-0fcb-4a41-825b-967df339ce57}}, {{cite:da03c257-58d7-46e7-a5c1-175a6416763b}}, {{cite:a3d98d7b-5f08-480e-908b-aa704e447aa9}}. We find that
the magnetic exchange energy is about 15 times larger than that of
the superconducting condensation energy, thus indicating magnetism
can be the driving force for electron pairing and superconductivity.
