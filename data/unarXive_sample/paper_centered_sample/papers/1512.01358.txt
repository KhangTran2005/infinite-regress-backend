Let FORMULA  be a field of characteristic 2.
We prove
that there are no smooth quartic surfaces FORMULA 
with more than 64 lines.
We also exhibit a smooth quartic containing 60 lines
which seems to give the current record in characteristic 2.

Introduction
This paper continues our study of the maximum number of lines
on smooth quartic surfaces in FORMULA 
initiated in {{cite:d9563ac5-57d1-46e6-ac19-11f3361ff076}} and {{cite:9e5f0a61-230f-4f4b-b271-81fb94c63258}}.
Starting from Segre's original ideas and claims in {{cite:1b9a3a23-3dce-472e-92cf-d9872a3963af}},
we proved in {{cite:d9563ac5-57d1-46e6-ac19-11f3361ff076}}
that a smooth quartic surface outside characteristics 2 and 3
contains at most 64 lines,
with the maximum attained by Schur's quartic {{cite:1fd824e0-f2d5-4200-9c58-fe191540c6f7}}.
In characteristic 3, this specializes to the Fermat quartic
which contains 112 lines, the maximum by {{cite:9e5f0a61-230f-4f4b-b271-81fb94c63258}}.
In characteristic 2, however, both these quartics degenerate
which opens the way to new phenomena.
The main result of this paper is
that the maximum number of lines still cannot exceed 64:
Theorem 1.1 
Let FORMULA  be a field of characteristic FORMULA .
Then any smooth quartic surface over FORMULA  contains at most 64 lines.

Unfortunately we do not know whether Theorem REF  is sharp.
To the best of our knowledge, the current record is at 60 lines,
attained by a quartic with FORMULA -action which we shall exhibit explicitly in Section .
We point out that unlike in other characteristics (by work of us and Veniani {{cite:d9563ac5-57d1-46e6-ac19-11f3361ff076}}, {{cite:9e5f0a61-230f-4f4b-b271-81fb94c63258}}, {{cite:fd1aefd4-938e-4d87-ad17-4cba1a45f950}}),
there exist non-smooth quartic K3 surfaces more lines than in the smooth case,
in fact with as many as 68 lines in characteristics 2 (see Remark REF ),
indicating how special this situation is.
We emphasize that originally we were expecting the bound from characteristics FORMULA  to go up in characteristic 2,
since just like in characteristic 3,
there may be quasi-elliptic fibrations
and the flecnodal divisor may degenerate.
With this in mind,
our previous best bound ended up at 84 in {{cite:9e5f0a61-230f-4f4b-b271-81fb94c63258}}.
In contrast,
this paper will show that quasi-elliptic fibrations
in characteristic 2 cannot arise from lines on smooth quartics (see Proposition REF ).
Then we will make particular use of special features of elliptic fibrations
in characteristic 2,
and of the Hessian, to preserve the original bound of 64.
The paper is organized as follows.
Section  reviews genus one fibrations for smooth quartics with lines
with a special view towards quasi-elliptic fibrations.
In Section , we discuss ramification types and the Hessian of a cubic in characteristic 2
to derive Segre's upper bound for the valency of a line of the so-called first kind.
Lines of the second kind are analyzed in Section , much in the spirit of {{cite:d9563ac5-57d1-46e6-ac19-11f3361ff076}}.
The proof of Theorem REF  is given in Sections  - 
by distinguishing which basic configurations of lines occur on the quartic.
The paper concludes with an example of a smooth quartic over FORMULA  containing 60 lines over FORMULA .
Convention 1.2 Throughout this note we work over an algebraically closed field FORMULA  of characteristic FORMULA ,
since base change does not affect the validity of Theorem REF .


Genus one fibration
Let FORMULA  be a smooth quartic surface over an algebraically closed field FORMULA 
of characteristic 2.
Assuming that FORMULA  contains a line FORMULA ,
the linear system FORMULA  gives a pencil of cubic curves;
explicitly these are obtained as residual cubics FORMULA 
when FORMULA  is intersected with the pencil of planes FORMULA  containing FORMULA .
In particular, we obtain a fibration
FORMULA 
whose fibers are reduced curves of arithmetic genus one.
Note that in general there need not be a section,
and due to the special characteristic,
the general fiber need not be smooth,
i.e. the fibration may a priori be quasi-elliptic.
In fact, we shall instantly rule this latter special behaviour out,
but before doing so,
we note the limited types of singular fibers (in Kodaira's notation {{cite:8ac60733-9dbf-47a3-b9ba-189b8b946595}})
which may arise from a plane curve of degree 3:
TABLE 
While this is already quite restrictive for any genus one fibration,
it determines the singular fibers of a quasi-elliptic fibration in characteristic 2 completely:
the general fiber has Kodaira type FORMULA ,
and for Euler-Poincaré characteristic reasons,
there are exactly 20 reducible fibers, all of type FORMULA .
It turns out
that this together with the theory of Mordell-Weil lattices
provides enough information to rule out quasi-elliptic fibrations in our characteristic 2 set-up:
Proposition 2.1 
The fibration FORMULA  cannot be quasi-elliptic.

Assume to the contrary that FORMULA  is quasi-elliptic.
Then FORMULA  automatically is unirational,
and thus supersingular,
i.e. the Néron-Severi group FORMULA  has rank 22
equalling the second Betti number;
endowed with the intersection pairing,
the Néron-Severi lattice has discriminant
FORMULA 
by {{cite:83402c07-5c8e-492e-91df-9f583635eb66}}.
We will use the following basic result
whose proof resembles that of {{cite:e4e2e6d9-41bf-4797-a9a8-d808b7259fb1}}.
Lemma 2.2 
If FORMULA  is quasi-elliptic,
then it admits a section.

If there were no section,
then FORMULA  would have multisection index 3,
thanks to the trisection FORMULA .
Hence we can define an auxiliary integral lattice FORMULA  of the same rank
by dividing the general fiber FORMULA  by 3:
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  can be interpreted as index 3 overlattice of FORMULA ,
we obtain
FORMULA 
By (REF ), this is not an integer, despite FORMULA  being integral, giving the desired contradiction.
We continue the proof of Proposition REF 
by picking a section of FORMULA  and denoting it by FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  induces a section FORMULA  of FORMULA 
which is obtained fiberwise by addition.
By the theory of Mordell-Weil lattices {{cite:4826d167-e75a-4900-b322-69c68782692c}}
(which also applies to quasi-elliptic fibrations),
the class of FORMULA  in FORMULA  is computed as follows.
Let FORMULA  be the number of reducible fibers
which are intersected by FORMULA  in the linear component,
and denote the respective component by FORMULA .
Let FORMULA .
We claim that
FORMULA 
To see this, it suffices to verify the following properties,
using the fact that FORMULA  modulo the trivial lattice generated by FORMULA  and fiber components:

FORMULA  meets every fiber with multiplicity one in a single component
(the linear component; this is assured by subtracting FORMULA  and the FORMULA );

FORMULA  (giving the coefficient of FORMULA  in the representation of FORMULA ).

But then the Mordell-Weil group of a jacobian quasi-elliptic fibration is always finite
(compare {{cite:125cf4e0-e5b3-4b5b-b71f-76140146ce09}}),
so FORMULA  has height zero.
Using FORMULA  and the correction terms FORMULA  from each of the FORMULA  reducible fibers
where FORMULA  meets the conic while FORMULA  always meets the line,
we find
FORMULA 
Since the equation FORMULA  has no integer solution
(reduce modulo 3!),
we arrive at the required contradiction.
Remark 2.3 
Once quasi-elliptic fibrations are excluded,
one can adopt the techniques from {{cite:d9563ac5-57d1-46e6-ac19-11f3361ff076}}, {{cite:9e5f0a61-230f-4f4b-b271-81fb94c63258}}
to prove without too much difficulty
that FORMULA  cannot contain more than 68 lines.
While this is still a few lines away from Theorem REF ,
it is an interesting coincidence that there exists a one-dimensional family of non-smooth quartic K3 surfaces,
i.e. admitting only isolated ordinary double points as singularities,
which admit as many as 68 lines:
FORMULA 


Ramification and Hessian
In this section,
we introduce two of the main tools for the proof of Theorem REF .
It is instructive that both of them have different features in characteristic 2 than usual.
Ramification
First we consider the ramification of the restriction of the morphism FORMULA 
to the line FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Since this morphism has degree 3,
is always has exactly 1 or 2 ramification points in characteristic 2
(because of Riemann-Hurwitz and wild ramification).
We distinguish the ramification type of FORMULA  according to the ramification points as follows:
TABLE 
The ramification type is relevant for our purposes
because often one studies the base change of FORMULA  over FORMULA 
where by definition the fibration corresponding to FORMULA  attains a section.
In fact, we will usually extend the base field to the Galois closure of FORMULA 
where FORMULA  splits into three sections.
Note that the field extension FORMULA  itself is Galois
if and only if FORMULA  has ramification type FORMULA .
Encoded in the ramification,
one finds how the singular fibers behave under the base change,
and more importantly, how they are intersected by the sections
obtained from FORMULA .

Hessian
We now introduce the Hessian of the residual cubics FORMULA .
To this end, we apply a projective transformation,
so that
FORMULA 
Then the pencil of hyperplanes in FORMULA  containing FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
(including the hyperplane FORMULA  at FORMULA ,
so everything in what follows can be understood in homogenous coordinates of FORMULA 
parametrising FORMULA ;
we decided to opt for the affine notation for simplicity).
The residual cubics FORMULA  of FORMULA 
are given by a homogeneous cubic polynomial
FORMULA 
which is obtained from the homogeneous quartic polynomial FORMULA 
defining FORMULA 
by substituting FORMULA  for FORMULA  and factoring out FORMULA .
Outside characteristic 2,
the points of inflection of FORMULA 
(which are often used to define a group structure on FORMULA ,
at least when one of them is rational)
are given by the Hessian
FORMULA 
In characteristic 2, however,
some extra divisibilities in the coefficients force us to modify the Hessian formally
using the FORMULA -coefficient FORMULA  of FORMULA 
until it takes the following shape
(understood algebraically over FORMULA  in terms of the generic coefficients of FORMULA 
before reducing modulo 2 and substituting):
FORMULA 
In order to use the Hessian for considerations of lines on FORMULA ,
Segre's key insight from {{cite:1b9a3a23-3dce-472e-92cf-d9872a3963af}}
was that FORMULA  vanishes on each linear component of a given residual cubic FORMULA 
(or, if FORMULA  is singular, but irreducible, in its singularity).
That is, any line in a fiber of FORMULA  (i.e. intersecting FORMULA )
gives a zero of the following polynomial FORMULA ,
obtained by intersecting FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA  (i.e. substituting FORMULA )
and taking the resultant with respect to either remaining homogeneous variable:
FORMULA 
More precisely, one computes that FORMULA  has generically degree 18,
and that each line contributes to the zeroes of FORMULA  separately:
Lemma 3.1 
In the above set-up,
assume that FORMULA  has

a fiber of type FORMULA  or FORMULA  at FORMULA ,
then FORMULA ;

a fiber of type FORMULA  or FORMULA  with double ramification at FORMULA ,
then FORMULA .


For degree reasons, one directly obtains the following upper bound for the valency of
FORMULA ,
i.e. the number of other lines on FORMULA  met by FORMULA :
Corollary 3.2 (Segre) 

If FORMULA , then FORMULA .

This makes clear
that we have to carefully distinguish whether FORMULA  vanishes identically or not.
Recall from {{cite:1b9a3a23-3dce-472e-92cf-d9872a3963af}}, {{cite:d9563ac5-57d1-46e6-ac19-11f3361ff076}}
how this leads to the following terminology:
Definition 3.3 The line FORMULA  is said to be of the second kind if FORMULA .
Else we call FORMULA  a line of the first kind.

We will next show that lines of the second kind behave essentially
as in characteristic FORMULA .
For lines of the first kind,
the different quality of ramification changes the situation substantially,
but it is not clear (to us) whether the valency bound from Corollary REF  is still sharp.
(The lines on the record surface from Section  have all valency 17.)

Lines of the second kind
Since lines of the second kind in characteristic 2
turn out to behave mostly like in characteristics FORMULA ,
we will be somewhat sketchy in this section.
That is, while trying to keep the exposition as self-contained as possible,
we will refer the reader back to {{cite:d9563ac5-57d1-46e6-ac19-11f3361ff076}} for the details whenever possible.
Let FORMULA  be a line of the second kind.
Then, by definition,
FORMULA  is contained in the closure of the flex locus on the smooth fibers.
This severely limits the way how FORMULA  may intersect the singular fibers.
As in characteristics FORMULA  in {{cite:d9563ac5-57d1-46e6-ac19-11f3361ff076}},
one obtains the following configurations
depending on the ramification:
Lemma 4.1 
A line of the second kind may intersect the singular fibers of FORMULA 
depending on the ramification as follows:
TABLE 

We emphasize that fibers of type FORMULA  and FORMULA  necessarily come with wild
ramification
in characteristic 2;
in fact they impose on the discriminant a zero of multiplicity at least 4 by {{cite:43d84380-a44d-4bcd-b9ce-6828b55eaded}}.
(In mixed characteristic, this can often be explained as two fibers of type FORMULA  merging
without the fiber type changing, compare Lemma REF  with {{cite:d9563ac5-57d1-46e6-ac19-11f3361ff076}}.)
As in {{cite:d9563ac5-57d1-46e6-ac19-11f3361ff076}} we continue to argue with the base change of FORMULA 
to the Galois closure of FORMULA .
By construction, this sees FORMULA  split into three sections;
taking one as zero for the group law,
the others necessarily become 3-torsion.
In practice, this implies that fibers of type FORMULA  and FORMULA  have to even out
– including the possible degeneration of two FORMULA 's to one FORMULA .
Since the latter fiber type automatically comes with double ramification
by Lemma REF ,
we can bound the possible configurations of singular fibers
(where the precise numbers depend on the index of wild ramification of the FORMULA  fibers):
Lemma 4.2 
For a line of the second kind,
the singular fibers of FORMULA  can be configured as follows:
TABLE 

Corollary 4.3 
Unless the line FORMULA  of the second kind has ramification type FORMULA ,
it has valency
FORMULA 
Else one has FORMULA .

It is due to this result that we will have to pay particular attention
to lines of the second kind with ramification type FORMULA .
As it happens, quartics containing such a line are not hard to parametrise;
in fact, a comparison with the proof of {{cite:d9563ac5-57d1-46e6-ac19-11f3361ff076}} shows that
exactly the same argument as in characteristics FORMULA  goes through:
Lemma 4.4 (Family FORMULA ) 

Let FORMULA  be a line of the second kind on a smooth quartic FORMULA  with ramification type FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  is projectively equivalent to a quartic in the family FORMULA  given by the homogeneous polynomials
FORMULA 
where FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA .

We will not need the precise location of all singular fibers of FORMULA 
in what follows,
but we would like to highlight the ramified singular fibers of Kodaira type FORMULA 
at FORMULA .
These degenerate to type FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  resp. FORMULA  divides FORMULA 
(unless the surface attains singularities, for instance if FORMULA  has a square factor).
Note that if FORMULA  is smooth and taken as in Lemma REF , then
FORMULA 
For the record, we also note the following easy consequence of our considerations
which we will use occasionally to specialise to jacobian elliptic fibrations:
Corollary 4.5 
If FORMULA  admits no section,
or if no two lines on FORMULA  intersect,
then FORMULA  contains at most 21 lines.

In the first case, since any line disjoint from FORMULA  would give a section of FORMULA ,
we know that all lines on FORMULA  meet FORMULA .
Hence the corollary follows from the combination of
Corollaries REF  and REF .
In the second case, the lines give orthogonal FORMULA  classes in FORMULA .
Since the latter has signature FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
the claim follows.

Proof of Theorem REF  in the triangle case
We will break the proof of Theorem REF  into three cases,
depending on which configurations of lines the smooth quartic FORMULA  admits.
They will be treated separately in this and the next two sections.
Throughout this section, we work with a smooth quartic FORMULA  satisfying the following assumption:
Assumption 5.1 FORMULA  contains a triangle (or star) composed of 3 lines.

Equivalently (since FORMULA  is assumed to be smooth), there is a hyperplane FORMULA 
containing the three said lines and thus splitting completely into lines on FORMULA :
FORMULA 

If neither of the lines FORMULA  is of the second kind,
then each of them meets at most 18 lines on FORMULA  by Corollary REF .
Since any line on FORMULA  meets FORMULA ,
we find that FORMULA  contains at most 64 lines as claimed.


If the lines are allowed to be of the second kind,
but not of ramification type FORMULA ,
then Corollary REF  implies again
that FORMULA  contains at most 64 lines.


To complete the proof of Theorem REF  in the triangle case,
it thus suffices to consider the case
where one of the lines, say FORMULA ,
is of the second kind with ramification type FORMULA .
Hence FORMULA  can be given as in Lemma REF ;
in particular, it admits a symplectic automorphism FORMULA  of order 3
acting by
FORMULA 
for some primitive root of unity FORMULA .
Note that FORMULA  permutes the lines FORMULA 
(or of any triangle coplanar with FORMULA ).
In particular, these three lines are of the same type.
As before, we continue to distinguish three cases:

If FORMULA  is of the first kind,
then consider the degree 18 polynomial FORMULA 
associated to the flex points of the genus one fibration induced by FORMULA .
Locate the singular fiber FORMULA  (of type FORMULA  or FORMULA ) at FORMULA .
Then an explicit computation shows that
FORMULA 
Since this divisibility exceeds the lower bound from Lemma REF ,
we infer from the arguments laid out in Section 
that FORMULA  meets at most 14 lines outside the fiber at FORMULA .
In total, this gives
FORMULA 
Together with Corollary REF , this shows that FORMULA  contains at most 63 lines.


Similarly, if FORMULA  is of the second kind, but not of ramification type FORMULA ,
then by Corollary REF , there are no more than 60 lines on FORMULA .


We conclude the proof of Theorem REF  in the triangle case
by ruling out that FORMULA  is of the second kind with ramification type FORMULA .

Proof of Theorem REF  in the square case
Throughout this section, we work with a smooth quartic FORMULA  satisfying the following assumption:
Assumption 6.1 
FORMULA  contains no triangle or star composed of 3 lines,
but a square comprising 4 lines.

We shall refer to this situation as the square case.
Our arguments are inspired by an approach due to Degtyarev and Veniani (see {{cite:fd1aefd4-938e-4d87-ad17-4cba1a45f950}}).
Lemma 6.2 
If FORMULA  contains no triangles or stars,
then each line FORMULA  on FORMULA  has valency
FORMULA 

Since the genus one fibration FORMULA  induced by FORMULA  cannot be quasi-elliptic by Proposition REF ,
the proof of Lemma REF  amounts to a simple Euler-Poincaré characteristic computation
as the contributions of the singular fibers (including wild ramification) have to sum up to 24.
Presently, since FORMULA  admits no triangles and stars by assumption,
FORMULA  can only have singular fibers of Kodaira types FORMULA .
Hence there can be at most be 12 fibers containing a line.
Denote any 4 lines forming a square on FORMULA  by FORMULA .
Order the lines such that FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA .
Consider the two residual (irreducible) conics FORMULA  such that the hyperplane class FORMULA  decomposes on FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
Then the linear system FORMULA  induces a genus one fibration
FORMULA 
with fibers of degree 4 – one of them is exactly the square FORMULA  of Kodaira type FORMULA .
Any line on FORMULA  is either orthogonal to FORMULA  and thus a fiber component of FORMULA ,
or it gives a section or bisection for FORMULA ,
thus contributing to the valency of one or two of the FORMULA .
In total, this gives the upper bound
FORMULA 
where the second equality follows from Lemma REF .
We shall now study the possible fiber configurations
to derive the following upper bound for the number of lines on FORMULA  which will prove Theorem REF  in the square case.
Proposition 6.3 
Under Assumption REF ,
the smooth quartic FORMULA  contains at most 60 lines.

Before starting the proof of Proposition REF  properly,
we note the possible reducible fibers of FORMULA :
TABLE 
Using the fact that additive fibers necessarily come with wild ramification
(so that they contribute at least 4 to the Euler-Poincaré characteristic, see {{cite:43d84380-a44d-4bcd-b9ce-6828b55eaded}}),
one can easily work out all fiber configurations possibly admitting more than 20 lines as fiber components:
FORMULA 
To rule out all these configurations,
we will employ structural Weierstrass form arguments specific to characteristic 2
(which apply since we always switch to the Jacobian of FORMULA ).
Similar arguments have been applied to the particular problem of maximal singular fibers of elliptic K3 surfaces
in {{cite:43d84380-a44d-4bcd-b9ce-6828b55eaded}}.
General set-up
In characteristic 2,
an elliptic curve with given non-zero j-invariant FORMULA  can be defined
by a Weierstrass form over a given field FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
As usual, this is unique up to quadratic twist,
but here twists occur in terms of an extra summand FORMULA ,
with FORMULA -isomorphic surfaces connected by the Artin-Schreier map FORMULA  over FORMULA :
FORMULA 
The main approach now consists in substituting a conjectural j-invariant,
given as quotient
FORMULA 
associated to the usual integral Weierstrass form
FORMULA 
Converting the twisted form of (REF ) with j-invariant from (REF )
to an integral model FORMULA ,
we arrive at the Weierstrass form
FORMULA 
which outside very special cases will be non-minimal at the zeroes of FORMULA .
Then minimalizing is achieved by running Tate's algorithm {{cite:40d5c06c-8326-4d22-822a-c33def0be5b0}}
which consequently gives relations between the coefficients of FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
or in some cases like ours leads to a contradiction.
By inspection of (REF ), the polynomial FORMULA  encodes singular or supersingular fibers.
For immediate use, we record the
following criterion which is borrowed from {{cite:57b93dc4-467d-464b-86c1-4545cfe0b126}}:
Lemma 6.4 
Assume that there is a supersingular place which is not singular.
Locating it at FORMULA , the FORMULA -coefficient of FORMULA  has to vanish.

By assumption, FORMULA , so the integral Weierstrass form (REF ) reads
FORMULA 
Writing FORMULA ,
the fiber of the affine Weierstrass form at FORMULA  has a singular point at FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is a place of good reduction, the Weierstrass form is non-minimal.
From Tate's algorithm {{cite:40d5c06c-8326-4d22-822a-c33def0be5b0}},
this translates as FORMULA  being in fact a surface singularity.
Equivalently, FORMULA  by Jacobi's criterion.
Example 6.5 
There cannot be a rational elliptic surface in characteristic 2
with singular fibers FORMULA .
Otherwise, FORMULA  for some squarefree degree 5 polynomial FORMULA  and with FORMULA .
Since the surface is semi-stable, Lemma REF  kicks in to show that FORMULA , contradiction.

Remark 6.6 Note that the criterion of Lemma REF 
applies after any Möbius transformation fixing 0,
and to any supersingular place that is not singular.
Tracing the non-minimality argument further through Tate's algorithm,
one can, for instance, show that there do not exist elliptic fibrations in characteristic 2
with configuration of singular fibers FORMULA 
(as occuring on Schur's quartic over  FORMULA
Non-existence of the configurations  FORMULA
In each of the said cases,
the j-invariant (REF ) is a perfect square.
Equivalently, FORMULA  arises from another elliptic fibration by a purely inseparable base change.
(To see this, apply the variable transformation FORMULA  to (REF ).)
In the first two cases, this would lead to a rational elliptic surface with five FORMULA  fibers;
this cannot exist by {{cite:1ee34afe-5fb1-4627-8c1d-00aa05008b6b}} (which can be checked independently as in Example REF  or REF ).
Similarly, the configuration FORMULA  cannot arise at all
because fibers of type FORMULA  are only related to type FORMULA  by inseparable base change,
so that the Euler Poincaré characteristics would not sum up to a multiple of 12.
For the last configuration, since the fiber of type FORMULA  comes with wild ramification of index 1
(by the Euler-Poincaré characteristic formula), it can only arise from a singular fiber
of the same ramification index and total contribution to the discriminant congruent to 2 mod 6.
By {{cite:43d84380-a44d-4bcd-b9ce-6828b55eaded}}, this uniquely leads to Kodaira type FORMULA ,
but then again with the five FORMULA  fibers the Euler-Poincaré characteristics do not sum up to a multiple of 12.

Non-existence of the configurations  FORMULA
Each of these configurations is semi-stable, so Lemma REF  applies
with supersingular (smooth) place at FORMULA .
In the first case, for instance, we can locate the FORMULA  fiber at FORMULA 
and write affinely
FORMULA 
for some squarefree polynomial FORMULA  of degree 5.
But then FORMULA  by Lemma REF , contradiction.
The other two configurations can be ruled out completely analogously.
Altogether it follows that the fibers of FORMULA  may contain at most 20 lines.
In view of the upper bound
FORMULA 
this completes the proof of Proposition REF .
 FORMULA

Proof of Theorem REF  in the squarefree case
Throughout this section, we work with a smooth quartic FORMULA  satisfying the following assumption:
Assumption 7.1 
FORMULA  contains neither a triangle or star composed of 3 lines nor a square comprising 4 lines.

In short, we will also call FORMULA  squarefree (meaning also trianglefree).
In the sequel we will use the following stronger version of {{cite:9e5f0a61-230f-4f4b-b271-81fb94c63258}}.
Lemma 7.2 
Let FORMULA  be an irreducible conic which is coplanar with two lines.
Then FORMULA  is met by at most 46 lines on FORMULA .

The proof of the claim forms the last section of the proof of {{cite:9e5f0a61-230f-4f4b-b271-81fb94c63258}}.
Lemma 7.3 
If FORMULA  is squarefree, then FORMULA  contains at most 60 lines.

By Corollary REF  we can assume that FORMULA  contains a pair of lines FORMULA  that intersect.
Let FORMULA  be lines on FORMULA  that meet FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be the lines
that intersect FORMULA  for FORMULA .
After reordering the lines, we assume FORMULA .
Suppose that FORMULA  for an FORMULA .
Then, by Lemma REF  the irreducible conic in FORMULA  is met by at most 44 lines on FORMULA 
other than FORMULA ,
and the claim of the lemma follows immediately, because every line on FORMULA  meets FORMULA  or FORMULA  or the conic.
Otherwise, we assume to the contrary that FORMULA  contains more than 60 lines.
After exchanging FORMULA , if necessary,
and iterating the above process, we may assume using Lemma REF  that
FORMULA 
In particular, we always have the lines FORMULA  on FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Assumption REF  guarantees that
FORMULA 
Consider the divisor FORMULA  of Kodaira type FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  induces an elliptic fibration
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  as fiber.
Naturally, FORMULA , being perpendicular to FORMULA , also appear as fiber components,
but we can say a little more.
Namely, by (REF ), each FORMULA  comes with at least FORMULA  adjacent lines,
say FORMULA  which are also perpendicular to FORMULA .
Since FORMULA , the divisor FORMULA  gives another FORMULA  fiber of FORMULA .
Altogether, since FORMULA , this endows FORMULA  with at least 5 fibers of type FORMULA .
The sum of their Euler-Poincaré characteristics clearly exceeds FORMULA .
This gives the desired contradiction and thus concludes the proof of Lemma REF .
Conclusion 7.4 Having treated the triangle case, the square case and the squarefree case,
the proof of Theorem REF  is complete.  FORMULA


Example with 60 lines
This section gives an explicit example
of a smooth quartic surface defined over the finite field FORMULA 
which contains 60 lines over FORMULA .
Motivated by {{cite:e04f5483-6785-4498-93c4-3b20a5f51001}}
where a pencil of quintic surfaces going back to Barth was studied,
we consider geometrically irreducible quartic surfaces with an
action by the symmetric group FORMULA  of order 120.
These come in a one-dimensional pencil
which can be expressed in elementary symmetric polynomials FORMULA  of degree FORMULA 
in the homogeneous coordinates of FORMULA  as
FORMULA 
There are 60 lines at the primitive third roots of unity as follows.
Let FORMULA  be a fifth root of unity,
i.e. FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  is a cube root of unity,
and FORMULA  contains the line FORMULA  given by
FORMULA 
The FORMULA -orbit of FORMULA  consists of exactly 60 lines
which span FORMULA  of rank 20 and discriminant FORMULA .
We are not aware of any other smooth quartic surface in FORMULA  with 60 or more lines.
