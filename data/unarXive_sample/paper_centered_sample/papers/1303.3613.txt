The competition between on-site Coulomb repulsion and Rashba spin-orbit
coupling (RSOC) is studied on two-leg ladders by numerical techniques. By
studying persistent currents in closed rings by exact diagonalization,
it is found that the contribution to the current due to the RSOC
FORMULA ,
for a fixed value of the Hubbard repulsion FORMULA  reaches a maximum at
intermediate values of FORMULA . By increasing the repulsive
Hubbard coupling FORMULA , this spin-flipping current is suppressed and
eventually it becomes opposite to the spin-conserving current. The main
result is that the spin
accumulation defined as the relative spin polarization between the two
legs of the ladder is enhanced by FORMULA . Similar results for this
Hubbard-Rashba model are observed for a completely different setup in which
two halves of the ladders are connected to a voltage bias and the ensuing
time-dependent regime is studied by the density matrix-renormalization
group technique. It is also interesting a combined effect between FORMULA 
and FORMULA  leading to a strong enhancement of antiferromagnetic order which
in turn may explain the observed behavior of the spin-flipping current.
The implications of this enhancement of the spin-Hall effect with electron
correlations for spintronic devices is discussed.

Introduction
Recent trends in the field of spintronics{{cite:9d34db76-ae45-4384-bf16-5ea8d99e01df}}, {{cite:afd0d29b-3e87-498f-b423-2428678d6351}}, {{cite:34b01edd-4430-4cf9-b12a-1525dde327e5}} exploit
the possibility of controlling electron spins by purely electrical
means without using magnetic materials,{{cite:46b6b5f3-8f77-4d1c-b70f-a7f733403a15}} which is at
the heart of the conceptual proposal of the Datta-Das spin field-effect
transistor.{{cite:8e9083a8-5362-42c8-9964-986307d69d0b}} Key to this possibility is the Rashba
spin-orbit (SO) interaction{{cite:b0282917-6121-460b-bf0b-4c85ffc5a18e}}, {{cite:6ef46cf4-9dbe-412c-9643-cfcf0951de7a}}
appearing due to structure inversion asymmetry of materials and which has
been shown to be tuned by gate voltages in semiconductor
heterostructures.{{cite:a46aa67f-1d84-4baa-ab1a-e3c8c3dd84ee}}
Although the main interest in the study of RSOC has been on its
ability of generating and controlling spin polarized currents,
another consequence of the interplay between
charge and spin degrees of freedom induced by the RSOC is a flow of
spins transversal to the flow of charge which is known as the
spin-Hall effect.{{cite:e05161e1-69f0-4046-a01f-969a9b2e1b9e}}, {{cite:889a8087-00ed-48ad-9f65-d13cf77ab5e8}}, {{cite:3a891c36-302b-4d28-93a1-0985811aa01f}}, {{cite:8b6b4f4f-c34a-4c97-b43d-b8517884c95a}} If
transport takes place along a planar strip, the spin-Hall effect leads
to a spin accumulation with opposite projection on both edges of the
strip.{{cite:73c6368b-18ef-4357-a944-cc87d63a4b27}}, {{cite:489a9b9f-7492-4192-99a2-1f842c88e2fe}} This has been experimentally
observed.{{cite:ef0a9d5e-6177-4d58-bb0c-172ee982695b}}, {{cite:4dc35879-c53b-46b8-8009-d5d20c764ed4}}
Hence, the spin-Hall effect provides a real-space separation between
up and down spin electrons, like two ferromagnets with
opposite polarizations, thus enhancing the metallic state and its
conductance, and these features could also be employed in spintronics
devices.
Since most devices and experiments about RSOC have involved
semiconductors, electron correlations have mostly not been included so
far in theoretical models.
However, there are some systems which have been recently considered
in this field where such correlations may play an important role.
In the first place, RSOC has been observed in oxide
heterostructures.{{cite:acbf55f4-bd32-4849-afbe-5d7f425dd0fb}}, {{cite:b3830b07-e29b-46ac-882d-a5639560568b}}, {{cite:72f16a68-dc56-4e9b-988e-279588f90735}} Important
effects of a RSOC have been experimentally observed in other
transition metal oxides, particularly the iridates where the relevant
degrees of freedom are the 5d electrons on the IrFORMULA  ions, and
where strong correlation effects are expected.{{cite:124dfc32-31e5-4fc1-a4d3-9fdf3a24fd03}}, {{cite:adcd8746-a7ee-483e-ad58-21223334fc74}}
It should be also taken into account that correlation
effects become increasingly important in systems with low
spatial dimensions. Interesting crossovers have been reported when
moving from two-dimensional (2D) systems to quantum wires.{{cite:9443bdfa-0d9d-4435-be22-63e56160ecab}}
In this sense, spin-orbit effects, predominantly of the Rashba type
have been studied in quantum wires.{{cite:0a1ee986-b9e2-4922-881b-54a2fbee1e03}}, {{cite:4aff8202-bd74-4dfa-8bfe-ac4da73ba2ed}}
The presence of RSOC in graphene and carbon nanotubes has been
pointed out{{cite:a6a0a993-1bd5-4197-a90c-eb06f5f65a78}} and in fact a theoretical study with up
to two interacting electrons has been done on a nanotube quantum
dot.{{cite:bbc35fba-36f9-4cd2-8fd0-b83ddf87f618}}
In this work, an attempt of studying the interplay between electron
correlations and RSOC will be performed by considering a Hubbard model
with a Rashba SOC. During the last two decades it has been realized the
difficulties of tackling electron correlations theoretically. In studies
of RSOC, electron correlations have been included only locally regarding
quantum dots{{cite:16fcc0d1-bfe1-47aa-8b03-733a22f23b2b}}, {{cite:23b8f8ee-b0bd-40da-84d8-431c1d68c38c}} or on effective onedimensional (1D)
systems using Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid approach{{cite:d08aef4f-5f2e-4b75-a305-ddbcaa115245}}
and conformal field theory.{{cite:7b7f1931-e0fc-417d-a12d-e4d82bc0e02c}} For
this reason, in the present work a two-leg ladder, which may be the
narrowest quasi-1D geometry on which a spin-Hall effect
could take place will be considered. The Hubbard-Rashba model on a
two-leg ladder is suitable for treatment using essentially exact,
unbiased, computational techniques, which have been enormously
valuable in the field of strongly correlated electron systems.
Particularly for mesoscopic systems, the full quantum many-body
interplay between different terms of the Hamiltonian can be
reliably captured. There are many compounds that contain two-leg
ladder structures such as cuprates{{cite:21e30856-2c32-4ac7-8c78-55e93c1a0c2d}}, {{cite:c500dad1-af9d-491e-ae08-8366a43a4af2}},
vanadates{{cite:b2f3a375-8cb1-4069-a799-36e0e212bf57}}, iron chalcogenides{{cite:9a790b27-2ce8-46e5-baf2-de70228ea801}}, and other
organic and inorganic compounds, although so far the presence of a
SOC has not been reported on such materials. It should be also
stressed that a Hubbard model in a two-leg ladder has been proposed
for carbon nanotubes.{{cite:b6bed595-17f1-4b1b-b49d-5bf0fd45a5b4}}
Then, the main goal is to determine and understand
the behavior of the spin accumulation as a function of the RSOC and
the Hubbard repulsion FORMULA . The interplay between RSOC and FORMULA  with
respect to a possible metal-insulator transition{{cite:d3dfba7e-8bb2-4609-89e4-b7d7c14340dc}} will not
be discussed in the present work.
FIGURE 

Model and methods
The Hamiltonian of the Hubbard-Rashba model in a
square lattice is defined as:
FORMULA 
where the notation is standard. The first two terms corresponds to the
usual Hubbard
model and the last term contains the RSOC.{{cite:9a4cd760-3e1d-489c-8e46-8e96095efa37}}
The couplings FORMULA  and FORMULA  are normalized in such a way
that FORMULA  (which is henceforth taken as the unit of energy).
The longitudinal (transversal) direction of the ladder corresponds to the
FORMULA -axis (FORMULA -axis), as shown in Fig. REF (a). The RSOC in
(REF ) corresponds to an effective Rashba electric field FORMULA 
along the FORMULA -axis, i.e. perpendicular to the plane of the ladder. Open
boundary conditions (OBC) are applied in the transversal direction. The
total number of lattice sites is FORMULA . Hamiltonian
(REF ) corresponds to the isotropic ladder, in which couplings
are the same along both directions.
The present study is limited to the quarter filled system (FORMULA ).
Weak-coupling analysis{{cite:5c69ee15-94d9-4241-bf54-9fba784d1666}} has shown that the Hubbard
model on the isotropic ladder at FORMULA  is at the boundary between
a metal (C1S0) and an insulating (C0S1) phase.{{cite:4f288698-55b3-4db4-a37a-62a8fc92ca4b}} Exactly at
the boundary,
where additional metallic phases are predicted to be stable, both this
study as well as numerical studies{{cite:f0ceff9d-5a93-46d8-b412-ffc3a3ed9aae}}, {{cite:4a072e29-4877-4d22-950d-704a136009ec}} and the present
results point to a metallic phase, even for the values of FORMULA 
here examined. As soon as FORMULA  is turned on, the occupied
bonding band will split leading to a four-point Fermi surface
and the system will behave as a metal.
In all cases, the length FORMULA , equal to the total number of electrons,
was set equal to FORMULA  (FORMULA  integer).
In order to induce persistent currents, a magnetic flux piercing the
ring formed by a closed ladder has to be applied (Fig. REF (b)).
This magnetic flux FORMULA  is included in the Hamiltonian by the usual
Peierls factors, which in momentum space is equivalent to replacing
FORMULA  by FORMULA  (units
in which FORMULA  have been adopted). These Peierls factors are
included in both the hopping and SO terms of (REF ). The
resulting Hamiltonian is studied using exact diagonalization (ED)
for FORMULA . For the noninteracting case, FORMULA , by working in
momentum space, ladders with FORMULA  up to 6400 have been
considered.
Due to the RSOC the total FORMULA  is not conserved hence all possible
values of total FORMULA  have to be included in the Hilbert
space. In order to reduce the Hilbert space dimension, translation
symmetry along the longitudinal direction has been implemented thanks
to the use of periodic boundary conditions (PBC) along the FORMULA -axis.
Notice that the ladder ring shown in Fig. REF (b)
is different from the 2D ring (Fig. REF (c)) that has been
intensively studied in the
non-interacting case.{{cite:a10dd7f0-a0dc-4a06-b317-a5eb457d1796}}, {{cite:5b045cd5-bc48-4baf-baa1-f7e44ea219a4}}, {{cite:1cc2a503-21db-4e89-9593-6ef88bc8937c}} Studies
including Coulomb interactions for these rings have been limited to few
electrons.{{cite:c6776105-c293-49f3-a67a-654cf5918d44}}
The total current is defined as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the ground state energy. The contribution from
the hopping term in (REF ), the hopping or spin-conserving
current, is then given by the usual current operator along the legs,
FORMULA . A similar current operator can be easily
derived for the contribution from the RSOC term in (REF ),
that is, the SO or spin-flipping current, FORMULA . Notice
that FORMULA  turns out to be proportional to FORMULA . Using the
Feynman-Hellmann theorem, the total current is given by
FORMULA . In ED calculations, FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  have
been independently computed.
The spin polarization due to the spin-Hall effect
is defined as FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the
total z-component of the spin on leg FORMULA . All physical quantities are
ground state averages, and hence, they are functions of the magnetic
flux FORMULA . In order to determine the effects of the Rashba and
Hubbard couplings on these quantities, the reasonable choice of looking
at their maximum values as a function of the flux FORMULA  was adopted.
The second setup considered in this work is shown in Fig. REF (d),
which corresponds to OBC along the FORMULA -axis. Here, at a given time the
two ends of a ladder are
connected to a voltage bias FORMULA  generating a time-dependent
regime which is studied by DMRG. Although various sophisticated
approaches have been proposed within DMRG to deal with this time
evolution,{{cite:6f364f8f-d360-4762-98fe-f981c4c036f5}}, {{cite:490508f5-fe51-44db-a9c7-4340f486a0fb}}, {{cite:eb0f6b66-8d95-4e1b-9de7-f595b9db9664}} the simple
“static" approach is implemented in the present work which is
enough to reliably capture the main physical features in the
small lattices studied. This is a non-equilibrium process, but a
small value FORMULA  was adopted. In this case, the total
current is computed as FORMULA , where
FORMULA  is the total charge in the left half of the ladder, and FORMULA  is
the time measured in units of the time increment FORMULA .
FORMULA  is computed as the average of FORMULA  between the first two
peaks of its time evolution, which can be precisely determined with a
relatively small number of retained states FORMULA  within the static
approach. The spin-conserving current
FORMULA  was computed at the central links of the ladder. FORMULA 
was computed using the same criterion as for FORMULA .
In DMRG calculations, FORMULA  and FORMULA  have been independently computed.

Results
Noninteracting case
The tight-binding part of the Hamiltonian is,
in momentum space:
FORMULA 
in the basis: FORMULA , where “1",
and “2" are the two legs of the ladder.
FIGURE 
For the general spatially anisotropic ladder:
FORMULA 
In the isotropic case here considered,
FORMULA , FORMULA .
In the tight-binding formalism, the currents FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA 
are independently computed for each value of the magnetic flux FORMULA ,
and hence the relation FORMULA  provides an internal check of
the calculations.
FIGURE 
For the case of persistent currents, Fig. REF (b), results for
the noninteracting FORMULA  case are shown in Fig. REF  for
various lattice sizes ranging from FORMULA  to 6400. For the total and
the hopping currents ((Fig. REF (a),(b)), a general trend to
decrease with increasing FORMULA  can be observed, although there
is a considerable noise due to various level crossings as a function
of the flux FORMULA . In addition it can be observed that
the maximum values of the spin-flipping current (Fig. REF (c))
and the spin accumulation (Fig. REF (d)) occur at
FORMULA . The general decrease of FORMULA  and
FORMULA  can be explained by a shift of the chemical potential
away from the bottom of the anti-bonding bands (Fig. REF (a)).
The behavior of FORMULA  is more complex and it is determined
by the competition between the fact that FORMULA  is an overall factor
in the operator FORMULA , and the increase in the shift between
the upper and lower spin bands (Fig. REF (a)) with FORMULA ,
which works against spin-flipping processes. For FORMULA 
the band structure does not change too much and FORMULA 
increases approximately linearly with FORMULA . For
FORMULA , the band structure changes more strongly and
FORMULA  starts to be suppressed. The behavior of
FORMULA  follows that of FORMULA , and it is remarkable
that in spite of the noise introduced by level crossings, the
ratio FORMULA  follows a smooth monotonous
behavior as a function of FORMULA  for large FORMULA , as shown in
Fig. REF (b).
FIGURE 

Interacting case
Let us discuss the correlation effects for the case of persistent
currents, for FORMULA . Fig. REF  shows the results
for the maximum values of the total
current, FORMULA , the hopping and spin-orbit contributions to the current,
FORMULA  and FORMULA , and the spin-leg polarization FORMULA 
on the FORMULA  ladder at FORMULA . As it can be seen in
Fig. REF (a), the total current for a fixed value of
FORMULA  decreases with increasing FORMULA . This result is expected
for FORMULA , i.e. for the pure Hubbard model, where it is well known
that the conductance FORMULA  decreases with increasing FORMULA , as in the
one-dimensional Hubbard model presenting a Luttinger liquid behavior
where FORMULA ,{{cite:393ed2a5-a35b-49ea-9d42-69f421a24039}} where FORMULA  is the
Luttinger exponent that determines the long-range distance
behavior of correlations. This behavior was examined for ladders in
Ref. orignac. The maximum value of the hopping current,
shown in
Fig. REF (b), follows roughly the same behavior with FORMULA  and
FORMULA  as the total current since it is much larger than the
spin-flipping contribution. The dip in FORMULA  and FORMULA  at
FORMULA  (Fig. REF (a),(b)) is just a finite
size effect as discussed above. On the
other hand, the behavior of the maximum value of the SO current is
quite interesting (Fig. REF (c)). For all values of FORMULA ,
FORMULA  increases with FORMULA  until reaching a
maximum which depends on FORMULA , and then starts to decrease becoming
eventually negative, indicating that its direction is opposed
to the hopping current, by convention. The most important results
correspond to the maximum value of the spin-leg polarization shown
in Fig. REF (d). One should first notice that FORMULA 
increases as a function of the Coulomb repulsion FORMULA  for all values of
FORMULA . In addition, its maximum value near FORMULA 
observed for the noninteracting case is preserved for finite FORMULA .
FIGURE 
The dependence of FORMULA  and FORMULA  as a function of the
magnetic flux, for FORMULA  and 1, is shown in
Fig. REF . Notice that increasing FORMULA  produces a smooth
change in the overall shape of the curve of the flux dependence of
the computed quantities, thus justifying the adopted criterion of
analyzing their maximum values as a function of FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In particular, what is interesting in this plot is that the
spin-flipping current FORMULA  (Fig. REF (a)) is inverted
for FORMULA  for FORMULA  thus becoming opposite to the
spin-conserving current FORMULA , as discussed before. For
FORMULA , this feature is observed already for FORMULA 
Fig. REF (b).
FIGURE 
Results for the voltage bias setup (Fig. REF (d)), for the
FORMULA  ladder, are shown in
Fig. REF . The behavior of the maximum values of the total,
spin-conserving and spin-flipping currents, and of the spin accumulation
as a function of FORMULA  for various values of FORMULA , are qualitatively
strikingly similar to those shown for the setup involving persistent
currents (Fig. REF ) in spite of the quite different background
physics involved. Notice that actually the maximum values of the currents
divided by the voltage bias FORMULA  are shown, which correspond to the
conductance FORMULA  up to a factor of FORMULA . Comparison with results for
the FORMULA  do not show appreciable finite-size effects.
FIGURE 
In Fig. REF  some typical time evolution of the total
current and of the spin accumulation are shown for various values of
FORMULA  and FORMULA . It is well-known that the time evolution of
the current follows an oscillatory behavior due to the interplay
between kinetic and potential energies. As the number of retained
states increases, or by adopting an adaptive scheme{{cite:490508f5-fe51-44db-a9c7-4340f486a0fb}}
in time-dependent DMRG, the current reaches a smooth plateau during
each half-period of the time evolution. The value of the current at
the plateau divided by the voltage bias FORMULA  is equal FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is the conductance (remember that units where FORMULA 
were adopted). In the present case, the adopted criteria of
measuring FORMULA  as the average of FORMULA  between the first
two peaks leads to a slight overestimation of FORMULA  with respect to its
exact value at FORMULA .
FIGURE 

Magnetic properties
Some possible explanations of the behaviors shown in Figs. REF 
and REF  can be obtained by examining the dependence
of various magnetic properties with the parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA .
FORMULA  and the static magnetic structure factor FORMULA  are
defined as usual from the FORMULA  spin correlations:
FORMULA 
where the normalization FORMULA  equal FORMULA  (FORMULA ) for up (down)
spin projections was used. With this definition, it is easy to find
that for the non-interacting case
FORMULA , where FORMULA  (FORMULA ) is the density
of electrons with FORMULA  (FORMULA ) spin in a state with
fixed total FORMULA . For FORMULA , FORMULA ,
and when FORMULA , FORMULA ,
since doubly-occupied sites become forbidden.
In Fig. REF (a) the average value of FORMULA , a measure of the
magnetic moment per site as a function of
FORMULA  and for various values of FORMULA  is shown. As expected,
FORMULA  increases with FORMULA , as it is well-known for Hubbard-like
models, and it is almost independent of FORMULA . Results for
the FORMULA  ladder PBC at zero flux are virtually indistinguishable
with the ones obtained for the FORMULA  ladder OBC using DMRG.
Note that for FORMULA , one gets the same value as for FORMULA ,
in spite of the fact that since FORMULA  is not a quantum number
for the model here considered, the ground state is a combination of
subspaces with all possible FORMULA .
More interesting are the results for the peak value of the static
magnetic structure factor FORMULA , which are shown in
Fig. REF (b) as a function of FORMULA  and for various values
of FORMULA . For large values of FORMULA , FORMULA  has a peak
at FORMULA , while for small values of FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is maximal at other values of FORMULA , all of
them with FORMULA , and in most cases at FORMULA . In
the first place, as in Fig. REF (a), it is expected that
FORMULA  is enhanced by FORMULA . What is unexpected is the
strong dependence of FORMULA  with FORMULA :
FORMULA  increases with increasing FORMULA , and
FORMULA  increases with decreasing FORMULA .
This is a combined effect of FORMULA  and FORMULA  since for FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is constant and clearly the slope of
FORMULA  with FORMULA  increases with FORMULA . Results for
the FORMULA  ladder show a stronger dependence than the ones
corresponding to the FORMULA  ladder and this could be explained
by the fact that in DMRG FORMULA  calculations, the only
included spin-spin correlations are the ones
measured from one of the central sites of the ladder.
The increase of the z-component of the magnetic moment can at least
partially explain the larger values of the spin accumulation observed
as a function of the Hubbard repulsion for a fixed value of FORMULA .
This is shown in Fig. REF (c) where it can be observed an almost
linear dependence of FORMULA  with FORMULA  which is expected
for an density operator. Of course, it is not trivial the dependence
of the slope and FORMULA  values with FORMULA .
The peak of the magnetic structure factor at
FORMULA , indicating the presence of an antiferromagnetic
(AFM) order could in turn
provide some insight on the suppression of the spin-flipping current
FORMULA  for large FORMULA  and FORMULA , shown in Figs. REF (c)
and REF (c). For an AFM order, two electrons occupying nearest
neighbors sites along one leg of the ladder would likely have spins
with opposite projections on the FORMULA -axis. For this configuration,
a spin-flipping hopping would be impossible while there would be no
problem for a spin-conserving hopping (except for a cost FORMULA ). Now,
once a FORMULA -hopping has occurred, creating a doubly-occupied site
and leaving behind an empty site, a FORMULA -hopping is now possible
from the doubly-occupied
site to the empty one. Hence the spin-flipping hopping takes place in
a direction opposite to the spin-conserving one thus possibly
explaining the observed change of sign of the spin-flipping current.

Conclusions
To summarize, we have considered perhaps the
simplest system where some features associated to Rashba spin-orbit
coupling can be observed.{{cite:489a9b9f-7492-4192-99a2-1f842c88e2fe}} This two-leg ladder
system is suitable to be studied by unbiased, essentially
exact, computational techniques, which allow to consider electron
correlations on an equal foot with spin-conserving and spin-flipping
hoppings. At quarter-filling it was observed that spin accumulation
is maximal at an intermediate value of FORMULA , independently of
FORMULA . By increasing a repulsive FORMULA , the spin-flipping current is
suppressed and it becomes negative for large FORMULA  and FORMULA , while
spin accumulation is enhanced. These two last features can be
explained by the increase of FORMULA  and AFM correlations,
the latter being a combined effect of FORMULA  and FORMULA . The present
approach could be extended to wider strips which could in principle
be studied by DMRG, and also by variational and diffusion Monte Carlo
(plus a fixed-node approximation), and to
different electron fillings.
In addition, some subtle and so far controversial properties, such
as spin currents, could be studied numerically on this class of strips
including electron correlations. Although the present study does not
include any dissipative mechanism, an enhancement of spin accumulation
by electron interactions together with a reduction of the overall
current are positive features that could be taken advantage in
spintronic devices.
