The FORMULA  surface of SnTe hosts one isotropic FORMULA -centered and
three degenerate anisotropic FORMULA -centered Dirac surface states.
We predict that a nematic phase with spontaneously broken FORMULA  symmetry will occur in the presence of an external magnetic field when the FORMULA  Landau levels are FORMULA  or FORMULA  filled.
The nematic state phase boundary is controlled by a competition between intravalley Coulomb interactions that favor a valley-polarized state,
and weaker intervalley scattering processes that increase in relative strength with
magnetic field.
An in-plane Zeeman field alters the phase diagram by lifting the three-fold FORMULA  Landau level degeneracy, yielding a ground state energy with FORMULA  periodicity as a function of Zeeman-field orientation angle.
Introduction.—
Tin telluride (SnTe) is now attracting great attention
as the first topological insulator (TI) protected purely by crystalline symmetry.
Although its electronic band structure has been understood {{cite:102992d0-b0a9-48a5-acdb-c3e87f68a017}} for decades,
the physical consequences of its band inversion have only recently been fully appreciated {{cite:f6a8b06a-e9a5-4f6d-9429-fc5824beb389}}.
SnTe has a rocksalt crystal structure with two inter-penetrating face-centered cubic lattices,
and its bulk bands are inverted due to spin-orbit coupling at four FORMULA  points.
The mirror Chern number becomes nontrivial in mirror-invariant planes that each contains a pair of FORMULA  points.
Based on this property, Dirac surface states on selected surfaces respecting mirror symmetries
were first predicted {{cite:f6a8b06a-e9a5-4f6d-9429-fc5824beb389}} and later observed {{cite:4db84f8a-2804-440b-9ad3-f98f4063c409}}, {{cite:1ffb1efb-78ba-4d21-8b03-b849fe65c866}}, {{cite:946daf90-e073-46e1-9475-39aecb0dbd05}}.
The FORMULA  surface of SnTe {{cite:9f04c354-74d5-4006-a07d-89fec40c524b}}, {{cite:5b3721ba-3ae6-40a5-862d-f669e9e69a96}}, {{cite:e36dca79-a921-43da-b99c-a6d61217d65b}}, {{cite:43ea546f-cdae-4b22-8542-7c7f7973e0d7}}, {{cite:3a1d167b-1215-4556-ab0c-f2e8e039c7d5}}, {{cite:d3f3bfc3-920f-49b1-9ca5-822ebde12061}}, {{cite:d26e1b93-e1da-4ddf-9a33-fc2e4384c296}}, {{cite:0e1ab0bb-80cf-4c47-9018-9d6bcad0a717}} respects three
mirror symmetries, and each protects an anisotropic gapless Dirac surface state at FORMULA  and
a partner isotropic state at FORMULA , as sketched in Fig. REF (a).
In crystalline topological insulators the top and bottom surfaces of
thin films can be electrically isolated {{cite:e36dca79-a921-43da-b99c-a6d61217d65b}} by
breaking mirror symmetries on the side surfaces while leaving them time-reversal-invariant.
This behavior contrasts with the case of strong TI thin films for which it is
impossible to study single surface electrical properties because sidewalls can be gapped
only by breaking time-reversal symmetry that generates Hall currents.
The FORMULA  surface of SnTe therefore hosts a unique
and relatively unexplored isolated two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
system in which the interplay between topological surface properties, valleytronics,
and many-body interactions is likely to yield unexpected phenomena.
The integer quantum Hall (QH) effect is a hallmark of any 2DEG system.
When a 2DEG has Landau-level degeneracies due to spin, valley,
and/or layer degrees of freedom {{cite:9ccefbaa-b562-4494-8d8c-498ba1629106}}, {{cite:5c9ba51c-e5f8-47da-84f6-29fd72cc8ae2}}, {{cite:f3e2029e-ae25-4405-b460-edb02f4be651}}, the interplay between Landau quantization and electron-electron interactions
often leads to ground states in which symmetries associated with the aforementioned degrees of freedom are spontaneously broken. Examples of broken symmetry states of this type, often referred to as
QH ferromagnets, arise in GaAs and AlAs quantum wells {{cite:c227f98c-9486-42e7-a60c-cee3a84e48f1}}, {{cite:3708130a-9d00-491d-aa4f-13a2caec9ed8}},
single and multilayer graphene sheets {{cite:cff26081-2e39-4217-bacb-b9c2bfdfc3c5}}, {{cite:9679bf79-d19b-474d-8bc4-1cd1e9db7592}}, {{cite:0b51d13b-1c80-4c6f-8732-c8b0cb03174c}},
and on the surfaces of silicon {{cite:afcfa210-8341-44b4-a40d-073bcc592e58}}, {{cite:83d017b9-6c43-4097-ac0a-ef7eac310b38}} and bismuth {{cite:c9441793-2bd6-474b-878c-0d63a6821c82}}, {{cite:94b3a000-0b9a-4377-9b4c-fd94108c424b}}.
In all instances of QH ferromagnetism studied to date, however, the noninteracting LL degeneracy FORMULA  has always been even.
Thus one may wonder whether QH ferromagnetism with odd FORMULA  exists in some material, and how in this case the ground state breaks Hamiltonian symmetries.
FIGURE 
In this Letter, we show that the FORMULA  surface of SnTe provides
a platform to explore FORMULA  QH ferromagnetism.
As illustrated in Fig. REF , the four Dirac cones on the FORMULA  surface give rise to four LL sequences. The three FORMULA  LL sequences are degenerate and related
by a FORMULA  rotational symmetry.
The FORMULA -FORMULA  LL energy difference is not restricted
by any symmetry, and can {{cite:d3f3bfc3-920f-49b1-9ca5-822ebde12061}} be tuned experimentally.
Under a uniform perpendicular magnetic field, these LL sequences
are interwoven in a non-universal fashion. We focus here on the case in
which the FORMULA  FORMULA  triplet is at the Fermi level,
well separated from all FORMULA  LLs,
and FORMULA  or FORMULA  filled to yield an integer total filling factor.
We find that when only the stronger intravalley Coulomb interactions
are retained in the theory, valley symmetry is spontaneously broken to
create a nematic state in which only one valley is occupied.
When the weaker intervalley scattering processes are retained, a
broken translational symmetry state with coherence among three valleys appears
beyond a critical magnetic field value.
An in-plane Zeeman field couples to the
nematic order parameter and influences the competition between broken rotational and
translational symmetry states.
Surface state LLs.—
The SnTe FORMULA  Dirac surface states are described by the FORMULA 
Hamiltonians {{cite:e36dca79-a921-43da-b99c-a6d61217d65b}}:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  m/s and FORMULA  m/s {{cite:d3f3bfc3-920f-49b1-9ca5-822ebde12061}}
are surface Fermi velocities, FORMULA  labels the three inequivalent FORMULA  valleys,
and FORMULA  is a surface Dirac pseudospin.
Microscopically the pseudospins {{cite:e36dca79-a921-43da-b99c-a6d61217d65b}}, {{cite:7b11133b-d111-49af-8ce5-00ee3decfd5e}} are valley-dependent
linear combinations of spin and orbital operators that
transform like spin under time reversal, spatial inversion, and mirror reflection.
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are explicitly defined in Fig. REF (a) for the FORMULA  valley;
local momentum-space coordinates in other valleys are obtained by
appropriate FORMULA  rotations.
In the presence of a uniform perpendicular magnetic field, the 2D kinetic momenta FORMULA  in Eq. (REF )
are replaced by FORMULA , where FORMULA .
The FORMULA  LL energies are  FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA ,
reminiscent of the massless Dirac fermion LLs in graphene and on cleavage surfaces of FORMULA .
Because the FORMULA  surface states have anisotropic dispersions with valley-dependent
orientations, we define valley-dependent raising operators
 FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA , where  FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA  is the magnetic length,
 FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA ,
 FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA ,  FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA ,
and FORMULA . With these definitions
FORMULA  becomes
FORMULA 

so that the FORMULA  LL energies and wavefunctions
are  FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA ,
and
FORMULA 

Here  FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA  is a normalization
factor,  FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA , and FORMULA  is the Hermite polynomial.
Also note that  FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA  and  FORMULAFORMULA 0. In Fig. REF  we plot LL spectra as a function of FORMULA  for cases with
the FORMULA  Dirac point energy above and below the
FORMULA  Dirac point energy.
All the FORMULA  LLs are non degenerate, whereas all the FORMULA  LLs are threefold degenerate because of the FORMULA  symmetry.
QH ferromagnetism in the FORMULA  FORMULA  0 triplet.—
We focus here on the case in which the FORMULA  LL triplet is FORMULA  or FORMULA  filled,
and ask whether Hamiltonian symmetries are spontaneously broken and whether broken symmetries give rise to charged excitation gaps which would yield an integer QH effect.
Because Coulomb interaction matrix elements are sensitive to the valley-dependent orientations of
the anisotropic cyclotron orbits, the Hamiltonian is not invariant under rotations in the valley-space.
However, the small size of the momentum-space cyclotron orbits
relative to their separation
implies that the number of electrons in each pocket is conserved; the only
allowed large momentum transfer processes simply exchange electrons between valleys.
Broken symmetry ground states are either Ising-like states in which the three symmetry equivalent
valleys are occupied by different numbers of electrons, or XY-like states in which coherence
is spontaneously established among three valleys
oriented along different directions.
The Ising-like state is a nematic one which
lowers rotational symmetry, and the XY-like state is a commensurate charge-density-wave state which breaks the crystal translational symmetry.
Interesting new physics is most likely to be experimentally accessible
when the FORMULA  FORMULA  0 triplet is partially filled because of the
large gap separating FORMULA  FORMULA  0 and FORMULA  LLs in Dirac systems. After projecting to the FORMULA  FORMULA  0 triplet, states at
FORMULA  and FORMULA  fillings are related by particle-hole symmetry within the triplet,
allowing us to focus on the FORMULA  case. In addition, we neglect the possibility of an accidental degeneracy between the FORMULA  FORMULA 
triplet and a FORMULA  LL.
We employ the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation {{cite:fba8e80f-b73d-42e6-bf08-1ce76cedb704}}
which is accurate {{cite:b4a4c168-c670-4c66-ab83-77a19d84b220}} at the integer total filling factors of interest.
We therefore minimize the energy of Slater determinant trial wavefunctions
by solving self-consistent field equations with FORMULA  mean-field Hamiltonians of the form:
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  is the single-particle LL energy which is an irrelevant constant that is subsequently set to 0, and
FORMULA  is the triplet density matrix.
In Eq. (REF ) FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA 
are respectively intravalley exchange, intervalley Hartree, and intervalley exchange integrals.
We use an envelope function approximation for intravalley processes,
which are enhanced by the long-range tail of the Coulomb interactions and therefore dominant, and approximate
intervalley processes using a phenomenological interaction constant
FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a primitive reciprocal lattice vector.
It follows that the Hartree integral is FORMULA ,
and that the exchange integrals are
[4]
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  {{cite:b5023332-ac8f-4fa8-824c-bb777d427459}}
is the effective dielectric constant,
and FORMULA  is a form factor that accounts for the system's valley-dependent
cyclotron-orbit shape:
FORMULA 
In the above integrals FORMULA  and
FORMULA ,
with FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
If the surface states were isotropic (i.e., FORMULA  and FORMULA ),
FORMULA  would reduce to the circular cyclotron orbit
form-factor FORMULA  {{cite:fba8e80f-b73d-42e6-bf08-1ce76cedb704}} that accounts for the quantum-smeared FORMULA  orbit size and shape. The corrections in Eq. (REF ) account for the anisotropy of the triplet
cyclotron-orbits, and for the FORMULA  differences in anisotropy orientation
illustrated in Fig. REF , which play an essential role in the interaction physics.
Because of the FORMULA  symmetry, the intravalley
exchange integral matrix FORMULA 
only has two inequivalent matrix elements, larger exchange integrals for electrons in the same valley (FORMULA )
on its diagonal and smaller exchange integrals for electrons in different valleys (FORMULA ) for its off-diagonal elements.
Because we take the interaction responsible for valley-exchange electron-electron scattering to
be short-range, the intervalley integrals have only off-diagonal matrix elements all of which
have the same value (FORMULA  and FORMULA ).
The broken symmetry ground state minimizes the total energy with respect
to the five parameters that characterize the valley spinor,
FORMULA ,
shared by all LL orbitals.
Up to a spinor-independent constant, the energy per electron is
FORMULA 

The FORMULA  filling ground state therefore depends on the sign of
a linear combination of the interaction parameters calculated above.
The energy is independent of FORMULA  and FORMULA  because
of separate particle number conservation in each valley.
The spinor-dependent factor on the right hand side of Eq. (REF )
reaches its minimum value 0 when the spinor is a single-valley state
FORMULA , FORMULA , or FORMULA  and its maximum value
FORMULA  when the ground state is an equal-weight three-valley state, FORMULA .
Exchange energies are always stronger between orbitals that are more similar.
Accordingly, the exchange integrals between electrons in the same valley are
stronger than those between electrons in different valleys (FORMULA )
because of the difference in cyclotron orbit orientations.
It follows that the ground state is completely valley polarized
unless intervalley scattering plays a role.
LL interaction physics in SnTe surface 2DEGs therefore contrasts strongly
with the case of graphene 2DEGs which has identical isotropic Dirac cones in
two different valleys, implying that FORMULA . Broken valley
symmetry states at FORMULA  in graphene {{cite:c1534bb2-e4eb-49b2-b1de-ebaaff2f2b96}}, {{cite:f5bba251-b940-499a-8ab6-e3ca6c801c02}}, {{cite:f4ff5ccf-1aee-454e-be4e-09e13ad3649d}}, {{cite:1c1815cc-68e2-4dd5-a628-858bba56a834}} therefore have Heisenberg character when valley-exchange processes are neglected.
For the relatively modest anisotropy parameter FORMULA  of SnTe we find that
the difference between the same-valley and different-valley exchange energies is
small, FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA . The short-range
valley-exchange scattering processes are approximated by a momentum-independent interaction with strength FORMULA  we find that FORMULA  is positive and scales as FORMULA . This allows the weak valley-exchange scattering to play a role at stronger fields,
favoring a ground state which has coherence between all three valleys, and is therefore a charge-density-wave state with broken translational symmetry.
For FORMULA  = 0.85 eVFORMULA nmFORMULA , a first-order quantum phase transition between nematic valley-polarized and
valley-coherent charge-density-wave states occurs at FORMULA .
In graphene {{cite:c1534bb2-e4eb-49b2-b1de-ebaaff2f2b96}}, {{cite:f5bba251-b940-499a-8ab6-e3ca6c801c02}}, {{cite:f4ff5ccf-1aee-454e-be4e-09e13ad3649d}}, {{cite:1c1815cc-68e2-4dd5-a628-858bba56a834}} and
monolayer MoSFORMULA  {{cite:f5c24f44-1926-465f-99c1-e7f2323b60aa}}, however, there is no competition with valley-dependent exchange, and the same mechanism induces a charge-density-wave ground state
at all field strengths at filling factors FORMULA .
FIGURE 
Zeeman field effects.—
We have so far neglected Zeeman coupling,
which greatly enriches the interaction induced integer QH effect of
SnTe. We write the total magnetic field as
FORMULA 

using the coordinate frame defined in Fig. REF (a) for the crucial
in-plane-field orientation FORMULA . For general FORMULA  the Zeeman field breaks mirror symmetries and
couples to the order parameter by producing valley-dependent single-particle energies {{cite:e36dca79-a921-43da-b99c-a6d61217d65b}}, {{cite:50e36916-1829-49d2-a00f-bcbe9f635f6d}}, i.e., FORMULA  in the HF Hamiltonian (REF ) with
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  is an electron FORMULA -factor,
FORMULA  is the Bohr magneton, and FORMULA  is the
real spin weight of the surface pseudospin {{cite:e36dca79-a921-43da-b99c-a6d61217d65b}}, {{cite:50e36916-1829-49d2-a00f-bcbe9f635f6d}}.
The perpendicular field FORMULA  does not break the FORMULA  symmetry and
contributes only an irrelevant {{cite:eba50c01-001c-48af-a645-72f1141c5eab}} valley-independent energy shift of the FORMULA  triplet.
In contrast, the in-plane field FORMULA  breaks
FORMULA  symmetry and lifts the FORMULA  triplet degeneracy.
It follows that in-plane fields can yield an integer QH effect at FORMULA  and FORMULA  filling of the FORMULA  triplet
even in the absence of interactions, as illustrated in Fig. REF (a).
When FORMULA  is parallel (anti-parallel) to FORMULA -FORMULA , the
triplet level degeneracy is reduced to a two-fold degeneracy
at FORMULA  (FORMULA ) filling.
When FORMULA  is (anti)parallel to FORMULA -FORMULA , the single-particle
gaps at FORMULA  and FORMULA  filling are non-zero and identical.
Valley dependent Zeeman coupling competes with electron-electron interactions,
and greatly enriches the phase diagram by adding
FORMULA  to Eq. (REF ),
favoring complete valley polarized states.
The phase diagram at FORMULA  is illustrated in Fig. REF (b).
For FORMULA ,
interactions prefer a valley polarized state and FORMULA  simply selects which valley is occupied.
First-order phase transitions occur at FORMULA .
When Zeeman coupling to a parallel field is included, the abrupt transition from valley-polarized to three-valley coherent states
is interrupted by a region in which FORMULA -dependent two-valley coherent states are stable.
The stability range of the two-valley coherent state is widest when
FORMULA . Finally,
when FORMULA  is further increased,
three-valley coherent states finally
emerge, but with FORMULA -dependent and unequal valley populations.
Valley coherence can therefore be modified and continuously tuned by the in-plane Zeeman field.
The shape of the phase diagram in Fig. REF (b) is only weakly dependent on the
numerical value of FORMULA .
The three first-order transition lines and FORMULA  are independent of FORMULA  changes.
A larger value of FORMULA  expands the areas with two-valley coherent states
to larger FORMULA .
Stronger short range interactions shift FORMULA  to smaller values because
intervalley interactions increase in importance.
On the other hand larger surface state anisotropy would
increase the critical perpendicular field FORMULA .
Discussion.—
We have shown that because of valley-dependent anisotropic cyclotron orbits,
intravalley electron-electron interactions in SnTe can reduce rotational symmetries
and lift the three-fold degeneracy of the FORMULA  valley FORMULA  LLs.
The physics which drives this broken symmetry
is similar to that {{cite:b438a352-ccb7-427d-8d6e-05cc0b99da2c}}, {{cite:29af6ce8-62b7-4e7d-92a1-b3e745833ce1}} responsible for valley
polarized nematic states in parabolic spinful band systems
with an even number of valleys. The triplet case discussed here
is distinguished by its FORMULA  order parameter space, and by the way Zeeman interactions
with parallel fields couple to the order parameter. Zeeman interactions play a key role because
parallel fields break the mirror and FORMULA  symmetries
that protect the three FORMULA  valley surface Dirac states.
Our theory can be extended to study QH effects on the surfaces of silicon {{cite:afcfa210-8341-44b4-a40d-073bcc592e58}}, {{cite:83d017b9-6c43-4097-ac0a-ef7eac310b38}} and bismuth {{cite:c9441793-2bd6-474b-878c-0d63a6821c82}}, {{cite:94b3a000-0b9a-4377-9b4c-fd94108c424b}}.
We predict that, intervalley interactions will become important at sufficiently strong fields and drive a transition from a valley-polarized nematic state to a commensurate
charge-density-wave state with intervalley coherence, and that the phase boundary between
them is enriched by in-plane field Zeeman coupling.
In the thin-film case {{cite:01c09b48-657b-48e0-b7e4-92fa78b133db}}, Coulomb interactions between 2DEGs
localized on top and bottom surfaces are important.
We expect that in this case integer QH effects at total filling factor FORMULA  will be spatially indirect exciton condensates.
Our theory can also be extended to study FORMULA  symmetry breaking in FORMULA  LL triplets.
In this case, we expect similar competing ordered states but smaller exchange interactions, and the Zeeman-coupling effect is enriched but will still retain the
FORMULA  periodicity in FORMULA  orientations.
The first step experimentally in studying the interaction physics we address would be to verify the LL
structure we predict using field-angle dependent magnetoresistance or magnetic torque magnetometry {{cite:c9441793-2bd6-474b-878c-0d63a6821c82}}, {{cite:94b3a000-0b9a-4377-9b4c-fd94108c424b}}.
The energies of FORMULA  and FORMULA  valley LLs are FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively.
Their crossings, illustrated in Fig. REF , should lead to pronounced peaks in longitudinal magnetoresistance.
We note the LL crossing fields may be controllable by varying the surface potential {{cite:d3f3bfc3-920f-49b1-9ca5-822ebde12061}}, which tunes the energy difference between the FORMULA  and FORMULA  Dirac points.
An in-plane Zeeman field splits the FORMULA -invariant triplets, with FORMULA  periodicity as a function of
Zeeman-field orientation.
Since Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations have recently been observed on the FORMULA  surface of
SnTe {{cite:c3d1addf-7bb3-4932-9c32-61088c8d8174}}, we expect future progress to be rapid.
The phase diagram Fig. REF (b) is expected to be observable only in low-disorder samples,
since the transport activation gaps associated with broken symmetry states are of the order of FORMULA  meV. The collective modes {{cite:72272148-5b68-4461-a328-7e1dce6d458d}} of valley coherent states are expected to be gapless,
while those of valley polarized states are expected to be gapped.
