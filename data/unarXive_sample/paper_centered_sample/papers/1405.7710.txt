We predict the distinctive three dimensional space motions of
hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and runaway stars moving in a realistic
Galactic potential. For nearby stars with distances less than
10 kpc, unbound stars are rare; proper motions alone rarely isolate
bound HVSs and runaways from indigenous halo stars. At large
distances of 20–100 kpc, unbound HVSs are much more common
than runaways; radial velocities easily distinguish both from
indigenous halo stars. Comparisons of the predictions with
existing observations are encouraging. Although the models fail
to match observations of solar-type HVS candidates from SEGUE,
they agree well with data for B-type HVS and runaways from other
surveys. Complete samples of FORMULA  20 stars with GAIA
should provide clear tests of formation models for HVSs and
runaways and will enable accurate probes of the shape of the
Galactic potential.

INTRODUCTION
From the Galactic Center (GC) to the Magellanic Clouds, three dimensional
(3D) space motions yield interesting information on the mass distribution
and stellar populations in the Local Group. At the GC, proper motion and
radial velocity data for several dozen bright O-type and B-type stars orbiting
Sgr AFORMULA  reveal the existence of a black hole with a mass of roughly
FORMULA  FORMULA  {{cite:de2094bd-2863-49eb-b151-51760e5e25af}}, {{cite:c519b17f-c2c1-4492-92c5-042ad337d3f8}}.
For the LMC, 3D motions of several thousand stars allow measures of the
orientation of the stellar disk and the mass contained within FORMULA  9 kpc
{{cite:ea5658e7-37f2-4cd7-b44b-ad1f032390d9}}. On distance scales intermediate between these two
extremes, accurate space motions of large groups of stars bound to the
Milky Way measure
(i) the rotation of the Galactic bulge {{cite:ac4f65ba-7cad-4606-af00-00ab7027de4b}},
(ii) the kinematics of nearby OB associations in the Galactic disk
{{cite:75f95612-8a15-422a-a137-de9572e171e6}}, {{cite:33b617d3-265d-4a03-9587-72b7abf0d802}}, and
(iii) the frequency of streams of stars in the Milky Way halo {{cite:2cbadcc6-8a9f-4c24-a2ff-32390b65a8ca}}.
Unbound stars ejected from the Milky Way can also probe Galactic structure.
HVSs are ejected from the GC when a close binary system passes within the
tidal boundary of the central supermassive black holeHVS ejections
also occur when a single or binary star passes too close to a binary black hole
{{cite:0ba1e729-7b30-423c-a659-799c37a29194}}. Here, we focus on the original Hills (1988) mechanism
for a single black hole at the GC.
{{cite:cad76a08-1407-4469-a985-c8fd58909f76}}. During this passage, one component of the binary
becomes bound to the SMBH; to conserve energy, the other is ejected at velocities
ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand km sFORMULA . Robust identification of
unbound HVSs in the halo enables more accurate measurements of the total mass
of the Milky Way {{cite:cedad227-da0f-4023-b83b-8b53283eabf7}}, {{cite:c7a15263-da2e-4baf-9ad4-c05e21deb34d}}. Because HVSs leave
the GC on nearly radial orbits, measuring the 3D trajectories of unbound HVSs
in the halo constrain the anisotropy of the Galactic potential
{{cite:24c8abb2-fbcf-4a94-8708-243d4453e63f}}, {{cite:e0aff0bf-14f1-4a54-b2a1-c549aa0eef48}}.
Space motions of runaway stars may provide additional constraints on the
Galactic potential {{cite:bd115575-e8b2-4867-bf85-f08a84fd4ac1}}. Produced when one component
of a binary system explodes as a supernova {{cite:99cdd805-c723-4baa-bead-1cd7885b066f}}, {{cite:abe14473-a1bf-4a55-b41c-6b0415a8d9e6}} or
when a star receives kinetic energy through dynamical interactions with several
more massive stars {{cite:75f61575-d0dd-4ee8-b089-f87f3734912b}}, {{cite:7c5986e2-253f-4239-8d09-19b7cd99eee6}}, high velocity runaways
have space motions and spatial distributions distinct from HVSs
{{cite:bd115575-e8b2-4867-bf85-f08a84fd4ac1}}, {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}. Separating unbound HVSs from unbound runaways
should enable more rigorous constraints on the mass of the Galaxy and any
anisotropy in the Galactic potential.
Realizing these possibilities requires robust predictions for the space motions
of HVSs and runaways moving through a realistic Galactic potential. Here, we
focus on calculations in an axisymmetric potential. Our results demonstrate
that proper motions (radial velocities) isolate nearby (distant) HVSs and
runaways from indigenous stars. Unique variations of proper motion and radial
velocity with Galactic longitude and latitude enable new ways to identify high
velocity stars. For observed high velocity stars, comparisons with the models
indicate a mix of HVSs and runaways, with a strong preference for an HVS origin
among the most distant stars.

OVERVIEW
To predict proper motions and radial velocities for HVSs and runaways, we
consider both analytic models and numerical simulations. For stars with
specific trajectories, analytic models allow us to derive the variations in
proper motion and radial velocity as a function of position in the Galaxy.
Numerical simulations yield predictions for the distributions of positions
and space motions for specific models of HVSs and runaways.
We begin in § with a formal discussion of the analytic
model. After defining cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate
systems (§REF ), we derive radial and tangential velocities
for stars (i) orbiting the Galaxy (§REF ) and
(ii) moving radially away from the GC (§REF ). Features in the
behavior of the radial and tangential velocities with distance and Galactic
coordinates provide a basis for differentiating the two types of motion.
Readers more interested in results than techniques can use the figures in
§ as a guide and concentrate on §3.3, where we summarize
the relative value of radial velocities and proper motions for identifying
HVSs and runaways among indigenous stars. For stars at distances FORMULA 
20 kpc from the Sun, radial velocities separate orbital motion from radial
motion. For nearby stars (FORMULA  20 kpc), tangential velocities may
discriminate ejected stars from bulge and disk stars, but probably cannot
isolate ejected stars from halo stars.
In §, we describe numerical techniques for simulating
HVSs and runaways moving through the Galaxy. Our procedures follow those
discussed in {{cite:ac11fc52-b852-42bb-99c9-2a06cc232b3e}}, {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}, and {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}.
Here, we focus on the input gravitational potential for the Galaxy
(§REF ), the initial conditions (§REF ),
and the integration technique (§REF ).
We discuss results in four sections. We start by considering the fraction of
ejected stars which reach the outer Galaxy with Galactocentric distances
FORMULA  60 kpc and high Galactic latitude, FORMULA 
30FORMULA  (§). With their large ejection velocities, 25% of
HVSs reach the outer halo. Much smaller ejection velocities prevent a large fraction
of runaways from leaving the inner disk. For supernova-induced (dynamically
ejected) runaways, only 1% (0.25%) reach Galactocentric distances of 60 kpc.
Roughly 0.1% of either type of runaway achieves Galactocentric distances of
60 kpc and FORMULA  30FORMULA .
In §, we examine distributions of the proper motion FORMULA  and
radial velocity FORMULA  for complete samples of stars produced in simulations
of HVSs and runaways. After exploring the density of stars in the FORMULA 
(§REF ) and the FORMULA  (§REF ) planes, we
examine the distributions of radial velocity and proper motion in specific
distance bins and distributions of proper motion for all stars in each
simulation (§REF ) and the density of stars as a function
of Galactic coordinates (§REF ). §REF  briefly
summarizes the highlights of these simulations.
To establish predictions for surveys with GAIA and other facilities, we
continue by constructing magnitude-limited samples of HVSs and runaways
for 1 FORMULA  and 3 FORMULA  stars (§). In the FORMULA  plane,
magnitude-limited samples of nearby, mostly bound HVSs and runaways with
d FORMULA  10 kpc have nearly identical distributions, complicating attempts
to isolate these stars from the indigenous halo population. Among 3 FORMULA  stars,
high velocity HVSs easily distinguish themselves from high velocity runaways.
Comparisons between the numerical results and observations of several sets
of high velocity stars complete our analysis (§). HVS and
runaway models yield a poor match to observations of solar-type HVS candidates
from SEGUE {{cite:41e37042-4770-45ef-8052-beeba6dd5325}}. However, the models provide
an excellent match to observations of B-type HVS candidates
{{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}},
nearby B-type runaways {{cite:c0fc5352-e9ce-44cc-adcf-e60cbc2085de}},
and miscellaneous HVS and runaway star candidates from other surveys
{{cite:edaad942-4547-4cc1-a40d-a37fc99a72d9}}, {{cite:b422dfca-b432-400a-8eb6-7ded2846ac95}}, {{cite:07c61e3a-c5b7-466e-b5e4-676f52787c8d}}, {{cite:98fd8023-0fee-4327-b4fe-e59eba772e87}}, {{cite:a83467b7-faa9-470a-95eb-82d2aeb44ff3}}.
Although radial velocities easily separate unbound HVSs and runaways from
indigenous halo stars, kinematic data alone are not sufficient to isolate
bound HVSs or runaways from halo stars (§REF ). Combined
with estimates of production rates (§REF ), these results
suggest that ejections from the GC are the source of the highest velocity
stars in the Galactic halo.
Our exploration of the space motions of HVSs and runaways concludes with
a brief discussion and summary (§).

ANALYTIC MODEL
Definitions
To establish a framework for analyzing numerical simulations, we consider an
analytic model for the proper motions of stars with simple trajectories in
the Galaxy. In a cartesian coordinate system with an origin at the GC,
stars have positions FORMULA  and velocities FORMULA . The
distance from the GC to the star is FORMULA ; the space velocity of the star
relative to the GC is FORMULA . The angle of the position vector of the star
relative to the FORMULA  axis is FORMULA ; the angle relative to the FORMULA –FORMULA 
plane is FORMULA . To distinguish these angles from standard galactic longitude
and latitude, we call FORMULA  (FORMULA ) the GC longitude (GC latitude).
In this convention, we specify coordinates in both the cartesian
FORMULA  and spherical FORMULA  systems {{cite:46fd0709-364f-4507-b940-d32d8f89cf8e}}.
These systems are appropriate for stars in the Galactic bulge or halo, where the
potential is roughly spherically symmetric. To make a clear link
with the cylindrical coordinate system more appropriate for the
Galactic disk, we define the cylindrical radius FORMULA .
In this system, we specify coordinates with FORMULA .
To connect these coordinates to the heliocentric galactic system, we assign
the Sun a position FORMULA  and a velocity FORMULA , where
FORMULA  = 8 kpc is the distance of the Sun from the GC
{{cite:25994db4-fd17-4bcf-a15e-7d31823e6469}}
and FORMULA  is the space velocity of the Sun relative to the GC
(Fig. REF ).
Each star then has a distance FORMULA  from
the Sun and a relative velocity
FORMULA .
In this system, the galactic longitude FORMULA  of the star is the angle –
measured counter-clockwise in the FORMULA  plane – from a line connecting
the Sun to the GC, FORMULA .
The galactic latitude measures the height of the star above the galactic
plane, FORMULA .
For FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Although these coordinate systems are clearly defined, angles in the
heliocentric galactic system span a smaller range than in the pure GC
system (Fig. REF ). For stars with positions FORMULA , the
range of FORMULA  (FORMULA  to FORMULA ) is larger than the range of FORMULA 
(FORMULA  to FORMULA ), where
FORMULA 
When FORMULA , FORMULA . For
each FORMULA , there are two valuesAmong other examples,
this classic degeneracy in FORMULA  plagues H I maps of the Galaxy. of FORMULA .
We derive the radial velocity FORMULA , the tangential velocity FORMULA , and
the proper motion FORMULA  in the heliocentric frame. For all stars,
FORMULA . The radial velocity is
FORMULA 
We separate the tangential velocity into two components,
FORMULA  and FORMULA , where FORMULA .
The component along the direction of galactic longitude is:
FORMULA 
The latitude component is
FORMULA 
For stars with FORMULA  0 and no motion in the FORMULA -direction, FORMULA . Although
each component of the tangential velocity has a clearly-defined sign convention, we
plot the absolute magnitude when we combine the two components into the tangential
velocity, FORMULA .
The standard definition for the proper motion is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is measured in km sFORMULA  and FORMULA  is in pc. To set the proper motion in
the heliocentric galactic frame, FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
where the velocities are in km sFORMULA . Positive (negative) proper motions are in the
direction of increasing (decreasing) FORMULA  or FORMULA .

Simple Trajectories
Within this framework, we consider several simple stellar motions to explore the
variation of FORMULA  and FORMULA  with position in the Galaxy. Most motions are composed
of both a circular component and a radial component. Starting with stars following
circular orbits around the GC inside and outside the solar circle (§REF ),
we derive the behavior of FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  for stars with
total velocity FORMULA . In this simple
example, we set FORMULA  = 0 and work in a coordinate system where FORMULA . The maximum
tangential velocity is then fixed at FORMULA ; the maximum radial velocity
falls with FORMULA  inside the solar circle and then grows with FORMULA  outside the solar
circle. At large FORMULA , FORMULA . Continuing with stars on purely
radial orbits (§REF ), we explore motions in the spherical coordinate
system appropriate for the bulge and the halo. For stars inside the solar circle,
the maximum radial and tangential velocities are FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Extrema in FORMULA  lie at FORMULA  0; stars have
maximum FORMULA  at FORMULA . Well outside the solar circle, the maximum
radial velocity (FORMULA ) is much larger than the maximum
tangential velocity (FORMULA ). At intermediate FORMULA  8–20 kpc,
there is a smooth transition from small FORMULA  and large FORMULA  to large
FORMULA  and small FORMULA .
Circular Orbital Motion
For stars following simple circular orbits around the GC, FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and FORMULA  = 0 (Fig. REF ). Although stars
in the thin and thick disks have finite vertical distances from the Galactic plane
and non-zero motion out of the Galactic plane, we set FORMULA  and ignore any
out-of-plane motion here. Thus, our radial coordinate FORMULA  is identical to the
standard cylindrical coordinate FORMULA . With FORMULA , the heliocentric radial
and tangential velocities are
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
In this system, FORMULA  = 0 and FORMULA . Using trigonmetric identities, we can
simplify these to:
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
For convenience, we can eliminate FORMULA  in the expression for the radial velocity,
FORMULA 
Fig. REF  illustrates the variation of FORMULA  (dashed curves) and
FORMULA  (solid curves) with GC longitude for stars with FORMULA  = 250 km sFORMULA  and FORMULA  = 5 kpc
(cyan lines) and FORMULA  = 50 kpc (magenta lines). In this configuration, stars on the
opposite side of the Galaxy from the Sun (FORMULA ) have no net
radial velocity and a maximum tangential velocity of FORMULA . For
FORMULA  = 250 km sFORMULA , FORMULA  = 500 km sFORMULA . Stars on the near side of the Galaxy
(FORMULA ) have no net radial or tangential velocity. Thus, the
minimum tangential velocity is FORMULA  = 0.
The behavior of FORMULA  depends on FORMULA . For all FORMULA , FORMULA  at FORMULA  and
FORMULA . When FORMULA , maximum positive FORMULA  is at FORMULA 
(FORMULA ). Maximum negative FORMULA  is at FORMULA . With a maximum
radial velocity, FORMULA , the amplitude of the
radial velocity variation declines from roughly 250 km sFORMULA  at FORMULA  0 to
roughly zero at FORMULA . Outside the solar circle, the extrema in
FORMULA  lie at FORMULA  (FORMULA ). With
FORMULA , the amplitude of the FORMULA  variation grows
from zero at FORMULA  to FORMULA  at FORMULA . Thus,
FORMULA 
In the heliocentric galactic frame, the variation of FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA  is
somewhat different (Fig. REF ). For stars inside the solar circle,
FORMULA  follows an egg-shaped loop with minimum and maximum velocity at FORMULA .
Here, FORMULA  sets the maximum extent of the loop in galactic longitude. Thus,
the `egg' widens at larger FORMULA , reaching FORMULA  at
FORMULA . Outside the solar circle, FORMULA  varies sinusoidally with FORMULA ,
with maxima of FORMULA  + FORMULA  = 500 km sFORMULA  at FORMULA  and a minimum of zero at
FORMULA .
The radial velocity also follows simple trajectories. At small FORMULA , FORMULA  varies along
a curved line with extrema of FORMULA  (eq. [REF ]) at FORMULA .
As FORMULA  grows, the curves extend to larger FORMULA  but have smaller maxima. At large FORMULA ,
FORMULA  follows a simple sinusoid, with extreme values set by FORMULA  at FORMULA 
and zero-crossings at FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Radial Motion
Stars moving radially away from the GC have subtly different behavior. To infer
conclusions appropriate for stars in the bulge or the halo, we consider stars
with a broad range of GC latitude. In the GC frame, outflowing stars have constant
FORMULA  for all FORMULA  (see Fig. REF ). In the heliocentric frame, nearby stars
have larger FORMULA  than more distant stars. For stars with FORMULA , FORMULA . Thus,
distant stars with large FORMULA  may lie inside the solar circle.
With FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and FORMULA ,
the heliocentric radial and tangential velocities are
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
When stars move radially outward through the Galactic plane, FORMULA .
With FORMULA , the equations for radial and tangential velocity are then very
simple: FORMULA  and
FORMULA . For stars inside
the solar circle, the maximum galactic longitude is FORMULA .
When FORMULA , the variations of FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA  and FORMULA  are more complex.
Aside from having a non-zero FORMULA , the amplitude of both velocity components declines
with cos FORMULA . For stars inside the solar circle, the maximum FORMULA  scales with FORMULA :
FORMULA  sin FORMULA  = FORMULA . Thus, stars inside the solar circle at large
FORMULA  have a smaller range in FORMULA  than stars with small FORMULA .
Fig. REF  shows the variation of FORMULA  (dashed curves) and FORMULA  (solid
curves) as a function of FORMULA  for stars with FORMULA  = 5 kpc, FORMULA  = 500 km sFORMULA , and FORMULA  =
0FORMULA  (violet curves), 30FORMULA  (blue curves), 60FORMULA  (cyan curves), and 75FORMULA  (magenta
curves). With FORMULA , curves at larger FORMULA  have a smaller extent in
FORMULA . For stars at FORMULA  = 5 kpc, the maximum galactic latitude is FORMULA  30FORMULA –40FORMULA .
Both sets of curves follow loops in the FORMULA  plane. For FORMULA  = 0, the FORMULA  curve
folds back on itself.
When stars lie inside the solar circle, the radial velocity varies symmetrically about
an average velocity FORMULA . This average increases with FORMULA ,
reaching FORMULA  at FORMULA  = 90FORMULA . With
FORMULA  30FORMULA , FORMULA . The amplitude of the FORMULA  variation
scales with FORMULA  and thus declines markedly from FORMULA 
to FORMULA  0 among the sequence of four curves.
The variation of FORMULA  with FORMULA  is not symmetric. At FORMULA  = 0FORMULA , the tangential
velocity ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum close to FORMULA , roughly 700 km sFORMULA .
At large FORMULA , FORMULA  approaches a constant value of roughly
FORMULA  FORMULA  for FORMULA  and
FORMULA  30FORMULA –40FORMULA .
Well outside the solar circle (FORMULA  = 50 kpc), the motions are much simpler
(Fig. REF ). At large FORMULA , FORMULA  varies roughly sinusoidally
with FORMULA  about an average velocity of FORMULA . The amplitude
of this variation decreases with FORMULA , reaching a constant FORMULA  when
FORMULA  and FORMULA  90FORMULA . Stars reach a minimum (maximum) FORMULA 
at FORMULA .
The tangential velocity has a smaller amplitude and different phasing with FORMULA .
At large FORMULA , the tangential velocity is roughly FORMULA , a result of reflex solar
motion. For stars close to the plane FORMULA  and FORMULA  0, the
tangential velocity consists of two sinusoids with amplitudes of FORMULA  and FORMULA 
(FORMULA ;
eq. [REF ]). Thus, the minimum FORMULA  is small and approaches FORMULA 
at FORMULA  = 0. Because the Sun is offset from the GC, the phase of minimum FORMULA 
is offset from FORMULA . The solar motion and position in the galaxy produce
an offset of roughly FORMULA 20FORMULA  in longitude.
For stars with 5 kpc FORMULA  50 kpc, there is a smooth transition
between the behavior shown in Figs. REF –REF .
Stars with in-plane distances less than FORMULA  (FORMULA ) follow the
trajectories in Fig. REF . Stars outside this limit follow the
trajectories in Fig. REF .
For an ensemble of stars with FORMULA  16 kpc, as an example, stars with
FORMULA  have FORMULA  and follow the trajectories
in Fig. REF . Stars at larger FORMULA  have the closed loop
trajectories in Fig. REF .
To illustrate this transition in more detail, Fig. REF  shows
the variation of the maximum and minimum radial velocity (lower panel) and
tangential velocity (upper panel) as a function of FORMULA  and FORMULA  for stars
on radial orbits with FORMULA  = +500 km sFORMULA  relative to the GC. At small FORMULA ,
the minimum FORMULA  is close to zero for all FORMULA . This minimum increases with
FORMULA  until FORMULA . The maximum FORMULA  is roughly constant at
500–750 km sFORMULA  at small FORMULA  and then decreases smoothly to FORMULA  at large FORMULA .
The extrema in FORMULA  have similar trends. Inside the solar circle, stars on
the near side of the GC all move towards the Sun and have large negative FORMULA .
On the far side of the GC, all stars move away from the Sun. Thus, the range
in FORMULA  is largest for stars inside the solar circle. Because FORMULA  scales
with cos FORMULA , stars at small (large) FORMULA  have the largest (smallest)
range in FORMULA .
Outside the solar circle, all stars in this example move away from the Sun.
The minimum radial velocity is then always larger than zero, producing the large
increase in minimum FORMULA  at FORMULA . Somewhat counterintuitively, the
maximum FORMULA  also grows with FORMULA . Stars with FORMULA  have the
largest velocity with respect to the Sun when they move radially outward
roughly along the FORMULA -axis. As FORMULA  increases, the angle between the FORMULA -axis
and the line-of-sight from the Sun to the star decreases. Thus, the radial
component of the relative velocity grows with FORMULA , reaching FORMULA 
when FORMULA .
Fig. REF  repeats Fig. REF  for heliocentric
distance FORMULA . Aside from a clear discontinuity in the minimum FORMULA  for
FORMULA  = 0 at FORMULA , the behavior in FORMULA  is almost identical to
Fig. REF . The
minimum FORMULA  crosses from negative to positive FORMULA  at FORMULA . The
maximum FORMULA  slowly increases to FORMULA  at large FORMULA . The variation
in the minimum FORMULA  is also similar, a slowly decreasing function of
increasing FORMULA .
The maximum in the tangential velocity, however, exhibits a clear maximum
for stars with FORMULA  30FORMULA  at FORMULA  = 8 kpc. Stars close to the
GC produce this maximum. When GC stars move radially outward in the
FORMULA –FORMULA  plane, their tangential velocity is at a maximum. For FORMULA ,
this peak in FORMULA  is a sharp feature. Although still visible for
FORMULA  5FORMULA  to 30FORMULA , the feature vanishes for larger FORMULA .

Summary
Despite the simple stellar motions in these examples, the behavior of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  is amazingly rich. For stars
inside the solar circle, circular orbital motion and radial outflow
produce large maximum tangential velocities, FORMULA .
These maxima occur at distinct galactic longitudes: FORMULA  0 for
stars orbiting the GC and FORMULA  for stars moving radially
away from the GC. Thus, proper motion measurements offer some promise
for distinguishing high velocity stars ejected from the GC from stars
on circular orbits around the GC.
Outside the solar circle, circular orbital motion is also distinct from
purely radial motion. For stars orbiting the GC, the maximum FORMULA  is
independent of FORMULA . However, the maximum tangential velocity of radially
outflowing stars gradually declines with FORMULA  until
FORMULA . This maximum FORMULA  changes little with FORMULA .
For distant stars, orbital motion yields a larger FORMULA  than
radial motion.
Trends of FORMULA  with FORMULA  and FORMULA  are opposite those of FORMULA . Inside the
solar circle, stars on circular orbits have smaller and smaller FORMULA  at
larger and larger FORMULA . For stars moving radially away from the GC, FORMULA 
has clear minima and maxima of FORMULA  at FORMULA . Outside
the solar circle, stars on circular orbits have maximum radial velocity
FORMULA  at large FORMULA . Stars moving radially away from
the GC have much larger maximum FORMULA , with FORMULA .
Thus, radial velocity measurements excel at separating distant stars on
roughly circular orbits from high velocity stars moving radially outwards
from the GC.
To conclude this section, we derive predicted proper motions for stars
moving radially away from the GC (Fig. REF ). Close to the
Sun, proper motions are large, roughly 100 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . The
range in proper motions is small (large) for stars at high (small)
galactic latitude. At large distances (FORMULA  kpc), the
maximum proper motion of roughly 1 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  results from
solar reflex motion.
At intermediate distances, there is a small `peak' at FORMULA  8 kpc
in the trend of FORMULA . Stars inside the solar circle with
FORMULA  produce this peak. For FORMULA  0FORMULA –10FORMULA , the
peak has the largest contrast with the general trend in proper motion
(see Fig. REF ). At the largest galactic latitudes
(FORMULA  60FORMULA ), the peak fades considerably.
These results demonstrate that radial velocities can isolate high velocity
stars from the space motions of typical stars in the Galaxy. Radial
velocity measurements succeed at large FORMULA , where observations can easily
separate HVSs or runaways with FORMULA  +300 km sFORMULA  from normal halo stars
with FORMULA  100 km sFORMULA  {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}.
Inside the solar circle, proper motion measurements provide a clear path
for isolating high velocity stars from bulge and disk stars orbiting the
GC. Among B-type stars with FORMULA  1 kpc, typical proper motions are
10–40 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  {{cite:75f95612-8a15-422a-a137-de9572e171e6}}. This motion is a factor of
3–10 times smaller than the predicted motion for nearby HVSs and runaways
with space velocities of 500 km sFORMULA  (Fig. REF ). The observed
velocity dispersion (FORMULA  100 km sFORMULA ) of stars in the Galactic
bulge implies typical proper motions of 1–5 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  {{cite:14d7b6df-e238-486a-ba08-dc179d51f451}}, {{cite:ac4f65ba-7cad-4606-af00-00ab7027de4b}},
smaller than the 10–20 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  predicted for high velocity HVSs and runaways
escaping the inner Galaxy.
For all distances, proper motions alone cannot easily separate ejected stars
from indigenous halo stars. The maximum proper motions of typical halo stars
with FORMULA  1–10 kpc, FORMULA  30–50 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  {{cite:0265e611-725f-4288-bb04-36991e1d2a03}}, {{cite:5af53939-7edc-4558-a71d-45d5c25c7685}}, {{cite:95f21129-446d-4bac-8b22-034e5d08d751}}, are comparable to the likely proper motions of typical ejected
stars. We return to this issue in §REF  with a direct
comparison between observations of halo stars and predictions from our
numerical simulations.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS
To explore the space motions of high velocity stars in more detail, we now
consider a set of numerical simulationsFor an analytical approach
to some aspects of our discussion, see {{cite:6ab00def-ba3c-4758-adfc-6ed523f90925}}.. As in previous papers
{{cite:ac11fc52-b852-42bb-99c9-2a06cc232b3e}}, {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}, {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}, we follow the dynamical evolution
of HVSs and runaways throughout their main sequence lifetimes in a realistic
Galactic potential. Snapshots of the ensemble yield predictions for the
radial distributions of space density, proper motion, and radial velocity.
In contrast with previous discussions, we concentrate on observables in the
heliocentric frame instead of the Galactocentric frame.
Building a realistic ensemble of HVSs or runaways requires two steps.
For each star with main sequence lifetime FORMULA , we generate initial
position FORMULA  and velocity FORMULA  vectors, an ejection time FORMULA , and
an observation time FORMULA , with FORMULA .
For a flight time FORMULA , we integrate the orbit of each
star in the Galactic potential and record the final position FORMULA  and
velocity FORMULA  vectors at FORMULA . Finally, we adopt a position and
velocity for the Sun to derive a catalog of FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA . Analyzing this catalog yields predictions for the observable parameters.
Gravitational Potential of the Milky Way
As in {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}, we adopt a three component model for the Galactic
potential FORMULA  {{cite:24c8abb2-fbcf-4a94-8708-243d4453e63f}}, {{cite:f46ed1df-d263-4cfc-b062-a9ea856f498c}}, {{cite:e0aff0bf-14f1-4a54-b2a1-c549aa0eef48}}:
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
is the potential of the bulge,
FORMULA 
is the potential of the disk, and
FORMULA 
is the potential of the halo {{cite:94e06ef6-f2cd-4159-a1f4-bf634376e942}}, {{cite:24ba99e2-a6c5-4ab9-a9b2-7e04b7c0584e}}, {{cite:4f37741f-d4b1-4c48-8c59-79331bd904d3}}.
For the bulge and halo, we set FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA  = 0.1 kpc, and FORMULA  = 20 kpc.
These parameters match measurements of the mass and velocity dispersion
inside 1 kpc and outside 50 kpc {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}.
To match a circular velocity of 235 km sFORMULA  at the position of the Sun
{{cite:91f1a134-ca77-4984-b2ec-19d6d8fd08d4}}, {{cite:25994db4-fd17-4bcf-a15e-7d31823e6469}}, {{cite:33b617d3-265d-4a03-9587-72b7abf0d802}},
we adopt parameters for the disk potential FORMULA ,
FORMULA  = 2750 kpc, and FORMULA  = 0.3 kpc. The complete set of parameters for
the bulge, disk, and halo yields a flat rotation curve from 3–50 kpc.

Initial Conditions
To select FORMULA  and FORMULA , we rely on published calculations for HVSs and runaways.
For HVSs, we consider a model where a single supermassive black hole at the
GC disrupts close binary systems with semimajor axes FORMULA  between FORMULA  and
FORMULA  {{cite:cad76a08-1407-4469-a985-c8fd58909f76}}, {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}, {{cite:5bcc2024-f1e4-4778-8d8c-80544864d70d}}. Our choice of the minimum semimajor
axis FORMULA  minimizes the probability of a collision between the two binary
components during the encounter with the black hole {{cite:1e762740-e67e-4e64-9cc3-4b5088935a99}}, {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}.
Setting the maximum semimajor axis FORMULA  4 AU limits the number of low
velocity ejections which cannot travel more than 10–100 pc from the GC and use
a substantial amount of computer time.
Hypervelocity Stars
Numerical simulations of binary encounters with a single black hole demonstrate
that the probability of an ejection velocity FORMULA  is a gaussian,
FORMULA 
where the average ejection velocity is
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  0.2 FORMULA  {{cite:ac11fc52-b852-42bb-99c9-2a06cc232b3e}}. Here
FORMULA  (FORMULA ) is the mass of the primary (secondary) star and FORMULA  is the mass
of the central black hole. The normalization factor FORMULA  depends on
FORMULA , the distance of closest approach to the black hole:
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
This factor also sets the probability for an ejection, FORMULA :
FORMULA 
for FORMULA . For FORMULA , FORMULA ; the binary
does not get close enough to the black hole for an ejection and
FORMULA .
To establish initial conditions, we select each HVS from a random
distribution of FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA . The binaries have semimajor axes
uniformly distributed in log FORMULA  {{cite:7b6ef387-c694-4c38-b4ab-e2f8dcba1a4c}}, {{cite:9ab9730a-8aa0-4ffc-8838-fbe27a697da4}}, {{cite:96ce6f32-2e9d-4d96-aa0e-7e9c51784dc6}}.
For binaries with FORMULA  = FORMULA , the maximum distance of closest approach is
FORMULA . We adopt a minimum distance of closest
approach FORMULA  = 1 AU. Within this range, the probability of any
FORMULA  grows linearly with FORMULA . Choosing two random deviates thus yields
FORMULA  and FORMULA ; FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  follow from
eqs. (REF –REF ). Selecting a third random deviate
from a gaussian distribution yields the ejection velocity. Two additional
random deviates drawn from a uniform distribution spanning the main sequence
lifetime of the star fix FORMULA  and FORMULA . To see whether this combination
of parameters results in an ejection, we select a sixth random deviate, FORMULA ,
and adopt a minimum ejection velocity FORMULA  = 600 km sFORMULA . Stars with
smaller ejection velocities cannot escape the GC {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}. When
FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA , we place the
star at a random location on a sphere with a radius of 1.4 pc centered on the
GC and assign velocity components appropriate for a radial trajectory from
the GC. Failure to satisfy the three inequalities results in a new selection
of random numbers.

Runaway Stars
For runaway stars, we consider two analytic models for the ejection velocity.
Following {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}, we assume runaway companions of a supernova
have an exponential velocity distribution:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  150 km sFORMULA . For a minimum (maximum) velocity of ejected
stars of 20 km sFORMULA  (400 km sFORMULA ), this distribution roughly matches simulations
of binary supernova ejections {{cite:690aca52-b962-4b1a-8826-03ec6db0cc88}}.
Predicted velocity distributions for stars ejected dynamically are much steeper
{{cite:86c2d5d7-d51d-45dd-af63-e146037528d7}}. To allow a reasonable number of high velocity ejections,
we adopt
FORMULA 
where FORMULA = 150 km sFORMULA  {{cite:86c2d5d7-d51d-45dd-af63-e146037528d7}}. In our standard calculations, we
set a minimum ejection velocity of 20 km sFORMULA  and a maximum ejection velocity of
800 km sFORMULA . To improve the accuracy of the statistics for the highest velocity
runaways, we perform a second set of simulations with a minimum velocity of
50 km sFORMULA . Together, these simulations yield a robust picture for the frequency
and observable parameters for runaways produced by the dynamical ejection
mechanism.
Both of these models yield small production rates for high velocity runaways.
To enable more robust comparisons with simulations of HVSs, we consider a `toy'
model where the ejection velocity is uniformly distributed between 400 km sFORMULA  and
600 km sFORMULA . Thus, we use eqs. (REF –REF ) to derive rates
for high velocity runaways and the toy model to understand the galactic
distribution of the highest velocity runaways.
Establishing the initial conditions for runaways also requires a set of random
deviates. We assume the initial space density of runaways follows the space density
of stars in the Galactic disk. Thus, the probability of ejecting a runaway from a
cylindrical radius FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
where the scale length is FORMULA  = 2.4 kpc {{cite:218221aa-878b-4c14-b194-b4177b18c1d9}}, {{cite:8d74968a-7f3b-420f-acfd-9b500deaf96b}}.
We adopt a range for the initial radius, FORMULA  = 3–30 kpc {{cite:3a896f76-4aba-4634-9c4e-d41ae821bff4}}.
Setting the position of the runaway requires two random deviates, one for
FORMULA  and another for the initial longitude in the GC frame. In this
approach, the initial height above the Galactic plane is FORMULA .
Once FORMULA  is known, we choose a random deviate for FORMULA  and two
random deviates for the ejection angles (spherical FORMULA  and FORMULA ).
Adding the velocity from Galactic rotation yields three velocity components.
We then choose a final random deviate for FORMULA . In these simulations,
ejections occur on time scales much shorter than the lifetime of the ejected
star. Thus, FORMULA  = 0.

Numerical Technique
To integrate the motion of each ejected star through the Galactic potential,
we use an adaptive fourth-order integrator with Richardson extrapolation
{{cite:f44345fd-f120-4640-963f-8c4e7dea0f9f}}, {{cite:deac4b78-5657-42f3-b7b8-e4262c738a0e}}, {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}. Starting from an initial
position FORMULA  with velocity FORMULA , the code integrates the full three-dimensional
orbit through the Galaxy, allowing us to track position and velocity as a
function of time. We integrate the orbit for a time FORMULA ,
which is smaller than the main sequence lifetime of the ejected star. This
procedure allows us to integrate millions of orbits fairly rapidly. Several
tests demonstrate our approach yields typical errors of 0.01% in position
and velocity after 1–10 Gyr of evolution time.

REACHING THE HALO
Before analyzing results from the simulations, it is useful to establish the
initial conditions which enable ejected stars to reach the Milky Way halo.
Stars orbiting the galaxy have a circular velocity FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  is the mass inside radius FORMULA . For our adopted Milky Way potential,
FORMULA  235 km sFORMULA  for disk stars with FORMULA  3–30 kpc. To reach the
halo, ejected stars must have a total velocity comparable to the escape velocity,
FORMULA . To set FORMULA , we calculate the velocity required for particles
starting from radius FORMULA  to reach FORMULA  = 250 kpc with zero velocity. For HVSs
ejected at FORMULA  = 1.4 pc, FORMULA  913 km sFORMULA . At FORMULA  3–30 kpc,
FORMULA  537 FORMULA  km sFORMULA . {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}
quote a more accurate, polynomial approximation to FORMULA  which is valid over
a larger range of Galactocentric distances.
With the definitions in §REF , many HVSs ejected from the GC
reach the outer halo. In our simulations, roughly 18% of HVSs have initial
velocities larger than FORMULA . Another 6% have ejection velocities,
FORMULA  850–913 km sFORMULA , sufficient to reach FORMULA  60–100 kpc.
For these speeds, typical travel times to reach the halo are 100–250 Myr
{{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}. If most HVS ejections occur roughly in the middle
of the main sequence lifetime, stars with FORMULA  200–500 Myr escape
the Galaxy as main sequence stars {{cite:ac11fc52-b852-42bb-99c9-2a06cc232b3e}}, {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}, {{cite:6ab00def-ba3c-4758-adfc-6ed523f90925}}.
Among the bound population of HVSs, most lie close to the GC. Roughly 60% of
ejected stars have FORMULA  = 600–750 km sFORMULA  and maximum distances of 1 kpc from
the GC. With their low Galactic latitudes, FORMULA  7FORMULA , detecting this
population requires infrared surveys. Another 5% have FORMULA  = 755–780 kms;
these stars have maximum distances of 5–20 kpc from the GC. Compared to the 18%
of unbound HVSs, the population of bound HVSs near the solar circle makes up a
small fraction of all ejected stars.
Despite starting far from the GC, it is hard for runaways to reach the outer
halo. In the supernova ejection model, the maximum ejection velocity of
400 km sFORMULA  is smaller than the escape velocity of 660 km sFORMULA  (430 km sFORMULA ) at
FORMULA  = 3 kpc (30 kpc). Although the maximum velocity in the dynamical ejection
model, 800 km sFORMULA , exceeds FORMULA  at all locations in the disk, few runaways
achieve such large ejection velocities. Typical velocities are smaller than
400 km sFORMULA . Thus, runaways need a boost from Galactic rotation to reach
the halo {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}.
To quantify the fraction of runaways which can escape the disk and reach the
outer halo, we consider the initial velocity of an ejected star with rotational
velocity FORMULA  and ejection velocity FORMULA . The angles between
the two velocity vectors are FORMULA  (in the Galactic plane) and FORMULA  (out
of the plane). The initial velocity of the star is then
FORMULA 
For any FORMULA , stars ejected along the direction of Galactic rotation
(FORMULA ) have the maximum initial velocity, FORMULA .
These stars have the best chance to reach the outer part of the Galaxy. Stars
ejected in the opposite direction (FORMULA , FORMULA  = 0) have the
smallest initial velocity, FORMULA , and the worst chance to reach
the outer Galaxy. When stars are ejected perpendicular to the disk (FORMULA  =
FORMULA /2), they have an intermediate velocity, FORMULA ,
and a modest chance to reach the halo. At other angles, FORMULA  has a constant
value when FORMULA  (sin FORMULA  = 0), which defines a
circle in the FORMULA  plane.
To calculate the fraction of runaways which can reach FORMULA  60 kpc, we derive
the allowed range of FORMULA  and FORMULA  for runaways with ejection velocity
FORMULA  starting from distance FORMULA  from the GC. Integrating over the appropriate
probability distributions for FORMULA  (eqs. [REF –REF ]),
the initial position (eq. [REF ]), and the ejection angles yields
the total fraction FORMULA  of runaways with initial distance FORMULA  that reach
FORMULA  60 kpc. To illustrate the difficulty of reaching the Galactic halo,
we calculate FORMULA  for all runaways and those with maximum FORMULA  30FORMULA .
This exercise demonstrates that few runaways reach the outer Galaxy
(Fig. REF ). Roughly 1% of all supernova-induced runaways
travel beyond 60 kpc (solid violet curve). Stars with initial positions
FORMULA  10 kpc contribute nearly all of the ejected stars. Within this
group, less than 10% (0.1% of all runaways) reach FORMULA  60 kpc with
FORMULA  30FORMULA . Although dynamical ejections into the outer Galaxy are
more rare (FORMULA  0.3% of the total population), dynamical ejections into
the outer halo are as frequent as supernova-induced ejections, FORMULA  0.06%
of all runaways.
The larger maximum ejection velocity in the dynamical model accounts for these
differences. Most runaways are ejected at 3–5 kpc, where the escape velocity
is large. With a maximum FORMULA  of 400 km sFORMULA , supernova-induced runaways
require the maximum boost from Galactic
rotation to reach the outer Galaxy. Sacrificing some of this boost to eject
stars into the halo keeps stars from reaching the outer Galaxy. Few of these
high FORMULA  runaways reach the outer halo. Dynamically ejected stars with ejection
velocities of 600–800 km sFORMULA  require little boost from Galactic rotation.
These stars easily reach the outer halo. Compared to the supernova model,
however, the dynamical model yields a smaller fraction of stars with high
velocities. The lack of high velocity stars compensates for the relative
ease of reaching the halo, resulting in comparable fractions of high velocity
halo stars with FORMULA  60 kpc in both models.
If the production rates for HVSs and both types of runaways are comparable, this
analysis predicts that HVSs dominate the population of high velocity stars in the
outer halo. For every high speed runaway generated by a supernova or a dynamical
interaction among massive stars, there should be roughly 100 HVSs. We will
re-consider this conclusion in §REF  when we examine
predicted production rates for each mechanism.

COMPLETE SAMPLES OF STARS
All ejection models yield populations of bound and unbound stars
{{cite:ac11fc52-b852-42bb-99c9-2a06cc232b3e}}, {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}, {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}. To explore the properties of
both populations, we consider simulations of 1 FORMULA  and 3 FORMULA  stars.
Calculations with long-lived solar-type stars provide a sample of bound
stars in the solar neighborhood and a sample of unbound stars with a
broad range of distances. While current facilities can probe the bound
population, most unbound stars are too distant and too faint for detailed
study. Although simulations with shorter-lived, more luminous 3 FORMULA  stars
yield a smaller sample of bound stars, the population of unbound stars is
well-matched to the sensitivity of GAIA and large ground-based optical
telescopes. These two sets of simulations allow us to derive general
predictions for the bound and unbound populations.
The numerical simulations of the motions of HVSs and runaways through the Galaxy
yield ensembles of FORMULA  stars with final positions FORMULA  and velocities
FORMULA  relative to the GC. These data represent a snapshot of all ejected stars
still on the main sequence. The HVSs fill a spherical volume from the GC out to
roughly 1 Mpc (34 Mpc) for 3 FORMULA  (1 FORMULA ) stars. Although runaways are more
concentrated towards the Galactic disk {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}, a few reach
Galactocentric distances of FORMULA  300 kpc (3 FORMULA ) to 7 Mpc (1 FORMULA ). To put
these results in perspective, the modern magnitude-limited surveys described in
§7 can probe 1 FORMULA  (3 FORMULA ) stars to FORMULA  = 10 kpc (100 kpc).
To derive heliocentric observables for each star in a snapshot, we set the Sun
at a position FORMULA  with velocity FORMULA  relative to the GC.
We adopt FORMULA  = 8 kpc and FORMULA  = 235 km sFORMULA  {{cite:25994db4-fd17-4bcf-a15e-7d31823e6469}} and
divide each ensemble into
five distance bins, FORMULA  10 kpc, 10 kpc FORMULA  20 kpc, 20 kpc FORMULA 
40 kpc, 40 kpc FORMULA  80 kpc, and 80 kpc FORMULA  160 kpc. Tables 1–2 list
the median FORMULA , first and third quartile FORMULA  and FORMULA , average
FORMULA , and standard deviation for the radial (FORMULA ) and tangential
(FORMULA ) velocities in each simulation. Table 3 summarizes statistics for
the proper motion. For runaways produced by dynamical interactions, we quote
results for simulations with a minimum ejection velocity of 50 km sFORMULA . Velocity
distributions for calculations with a smaller ejection velocity of 20 km sFORMULA  are
fairly similar to those for supernova-induced runaways.
In the next subsections, we examine several broad trends in the variation
of FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA . After discussing predicted
distributions of stars in the FORMULA  (§REF ) and FORMULA 
(§REF ) planes, we describe predicted histograms for FORMULA 
and FORMULA  in well-defined distances bins and for the complete ensemble of
stars in each simulation (§REF ). To isolate how observables
depend on Galactic coordinates, we then discuss the distribution of stars in
the FORMULA  plane for specific ranges of Galactic latitude
(§REF ). This section concludes with a brief summary of the
major results (§REF ).
Ejected Stars in the FORMULA  Plane
To investigate the distribution of stars as a function of FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
we construct a density diagram. For stars with FORMULA  30FORMULA , we
(i) divide the log FORMULA –log FORMULA  plane into bins spaced by 0.01 in log FORMULA 
and log FORMULA , (ii) count the number of stars in each bin, and (iii) plot the
relative number in a contour diagram. In each diagram, bright red represents
the largest density; dark blue the smallest density. The full range in
relative density varies from a factor of 5–10 for 1 FORMULA  runaways to a
factor of 50–500 for 1–3 FORMULA  HVSs.
Fig. REF  shows predicted density distributions for 3 FORMULA  HVSs
and runaways. Fig. REF  plots predictions for 1 FORMULA  stars.
The HVS results assume stars ejected from equal mass binaries
(1 FORMULA : FORMULA  = 0.032–4 AU,
FORMULA  = 10 Gyr; 3 FORMULA : FORMULA  = 0.115–4 AU, FORMULA  = 350 Myr). For
the runaway simulations, we adopt minimum ejection velocities of 20 km sFORMULA  (supernova
ejections) or 50 km sFORMULA  (dynamical ejections). Eliminating the lower velocity
dynamical ejections artificially enhances the density at large proper motions
relative to small proper motions. This enhancement provides a clearer picture of
the relative frequency of the highest velocity runaways.
These results demonstrate that nearly all of the proper motions for 3 FORMULA  HVSs
result from reflex solar motion (Fig. REF , upper panel). Most HVSs fall
close to the line
FORMULA 
At fixed FORMULA , stars with smaller FORMULA  have smaller FORMULA  (see also
Fig. REF ). Along the locus, the number of 3 FORMULA  HVSs peaks
at FORMULA  50 kpc.
Above the FORMULA  locus, there is a cloud of stars with FORMULA  10–20 kpc
and FORMULA  100 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . This group of mostly bound HVSs lies at all FORMULA 
in the direction of the GC. Stars ejected along the FORMULA -axis produce this clump
of high proper motion stars (see Fig. REF ).
Although runaways generally follow the FORMULA  relation expected for reflex solar
motion, the distribution about this relation is much more diffuse than for HVSs
(Fig. REF , middle and lower panels). Galactic rotation produces this
fuzziness. In HVS ejections, the distribution of ejection velocities is gaussian;
the position of a star along the FORMULA  relation is a simple function of this
ejection velocity and the flight time. In runaway ejections, the ejection velocity
consists of Galactic rotation plus a random velocity with a random angle relative
to Galactic rotation. This randomness creates a much larger dispersion of space
velocities and much larger dispersion about the simple FORMULA  relation.
For FORMULA  20–100 kpc, galactic rotation also produces twin peaks in the
density at fixed distance. Separated by roughly 0.3 in log FORMULA , these twin
density maxima are very prominent in the ensemble of supernova-induced runaways
(middle panel) and less prominent among the dynamically generated runaways
(lower panel). For runaways in the
Galactic anti-center, the rotational component of their motion is parallel to the
Sun's motion. These stars lie in the low proper motion peak. Distant runaways in
the direction of the GC are beyond the GC; the rotational component of their space
motion is anti-parallel to the Sun's motion. These stars produce the high proper
motion peak. Nearby indigenous disk stars in the direction of the GC have rotational
motions parallel to the Sun, eliminating the double-peaked aspect of the proper
motion distribution.
The larger maximum velocities from dynamical ejections blur the double-peaked
distributions of proper motions identified in runaways from supernovae
(Fig. REF , lower panel). Despite the diffuse nature of the contour
diagram, Galactic rotation is clearly visible at 20–50 kpc. As with HVSs and
supernova-induced runaways, the width of the proper motion distribution narrows
with increasing distance.
Results for 1 FORMULA  HVSs and runaways are similar (Fig. REF ). The
HVSs closely follow the linear FORMULA  relation out to FORMULA  = 30 Mpc
(Fig. REF , upper panel). The density of 1 FORMULA  HVSs has two clear
maxima at FORMULA  10 kpc and FORMULA  2–3 Mpc. Stars at high FORMULA  closely
follow the line (red contour); stars at FORMULA  30FORMULA  occupy the blue contour
below the line. At FORMULA  10 kpc, there is a group of stars with large FORMULA 
above the red contour. High velocity ejections along the Galactic poles produce
this collection of large proper motion stars (see also Fig. REF ).
Despite their lower frequency, 1 FORMULA  runaways also clearly follow the linear
FORMULA  relation expected for solar reflex motion. Aside from having a shape similar
to the contours for the 3 FORMULA  runaways, the contours for 1 FORMULA  runaways extend
to slightly larger distances due to their longer main sequence lifetimes.
The number and location of density peaks for HVSs in Fig. REF –REF 
depend solely on stellar lifetime {{cite:ac11fc52-b852-42bb-99c9-2a06cc232b3e}}, {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}. For
ejected stars with infinite lifetimes, the space density FORMULA  is a simple power-law
with distance from the GC, FORMULA . Thus, the total number of HVSs grows
monotonically with distance. However, real HVSs have finite lifetimes. The total
number falls at distances where the travel time exceeds the main sequence lfetime.
For 1 FORMULA  (3 FORMULA ) HVSs with ejection velocities drawn from eq. (REF ),
lifetimes of 10 Gyr (350 Myr) result in peaks at 2–3 Mpc (50 kpc). The second peak
in the density of 1 FORMULA  stars results from bound stars with orbital periods smaller
than the main sequence lifetime. Continuous ejection of relatively low velocity HVSs
over 10 Gyr produces a large concentration of bound 1 FORMULA  HVSs with FORMULA  20 kpc.
The short lifetimes of 3 FORMULA  HVSs preclude a significant concentration of nearby
HVSs.
The space density of stars in the disk sets the density of runaways in these diagrams.
For stars with an exponential distribution of ejection velocities, unbound stars are
very rare (§). Thus, most stars in the diagram are bound to the
Galaxy. For bound stars at FORMULA  30FORMULA , the final in-plane distance from the GC,
FORMULA , is similar to the initial distance, FORMULA . The space density of these
stars follows the initial density, which is concentrated towards the GC. As a result,
most stars have FORMULA  10–20 kpc.
In both diagrams, the dynamical and supernova ejection scenarios produce an ensemble
of stars at FORMULA  10 kpc with smaller proper motions than the locus of stars
with solar reflex motion. Within this group, stars with the smallest FORMULA  are
concentrated towards small FORMULA  at a variety of Galactic longitudes
FORMULA 100FORMULA –280FORMULA  where the tangential velocity reaches a minimum.
Some of these stars have large ejection velocities parallel to the Sun's trajectory
(see Fig. REF ). Others have modest ejection velocities perpendicular
the plane, which enable them to reach large FORMULA  but not escape the Galaxy
(see Fig. REF ).

Ejected Stars in the FORMULA -FORMULA  Plane
To explore the variation of radial velocity with distance, we examine another
density diagram. As in the previous section, we (i) select stars with FORMULA 
30FORMULA , (ii) divide the log FORMULA –FORMULA  plane into bins spaced by 0.01 in log FORMULA 
and 20 km sFORMULA  in FORMULA , and (iii) count the number of stars in each bin. In the
diagrams, bright red represents the largest density; dark blue the smallest
density. The range in density varies from a factor of 50 for 1 FORMULA  runaways
to a factor of 300 for 3 FORMULA  HVSs and runaways.
HVSs and runaways from supernovae show a remarkable diversity in the relative
density of 1 FORMULA  stars as a function of FORMULA  and FORMULA  (Fig. REF ).
Close to the Sun (FORMULA  1–3 kpc), the relatively few HVSs and runaways
have fairly symmetric velocity distributions around a median FORMULA  0 km sFORMULA .
At moderate distances (FORMULA  3–20 kpc), the spread in radial velocity grows
smoothly with distance. Although HVSs have a much larger spread in radial velocity
(see also Table 1), both groups have a clear peak in the relative number of stars
at FORMULA  10 kpc and FORMULA  0–100 km sFORMULA .
For stars at large distances (FORMULA  20 kpc), the velocity distributions
of HVSs and supernova-induced runaways differ dramatically. With their modest
maximum ejection velocities, few runaways reach the outer Galaxy (§;
Fig. REF ). For FORMULA  20 kpc, the density of runaways drops
significantly and falls very close to zero at FORMULA  100 kpc. Despite the steep
fall in relative density, the median velocity and the spread in radial velocity are
roughly constant with distance (Table 1).
The properties of distant HVSs provide a clear contrast with distant runaways.
For HVSs, the median radial velocity and the spread in the radial velocity grow
with distance. The maximum radial velocity increases from roughly 1000 km sFORMULA  at
FORMULA  10 kpc to 3000 km sFORMULA  at FORMULA  10–20 Mpc. Although the relative
density of HVSs falls from 20 kpc to 300 kpc, the relative density displays a
clear secondary peak at FORMULA  2 Mpc and FORMULA  400–500 km sFORMULA .
Beyond 5 Mpc, the density slowly falls and reaches roughly zero at FORMULA 
20 Mpc.
The distributions of 3 FORMULA  runaways are similar to those of 1 FORMULA  runaways
(Fig. REF ). In the middle panel, supernova-induced runaways show a
clear increase in relative density from FORMULA  300 pc to FORMULA  10 kpc.
Within this range of distances, the spread in the radial velocity grows smoothly
with distance; the median FORMULA  is close to zero. Beyond this peak, the relative
density drops to zero at FORMULA  100 kpc. Among the more distant stars, the
maximum FORMULA  is roughly constant with distance; the minimum FORMULA  grows slowly
with distance.
Dynamically-generated runaways yield similar results. When we adopt a minimum
FORMULA  = 20 km sFORMULA  for dynamically-generated runaways, the distribution is
nearly indistinguishable from the middle panel of Fig. REF . Increasing
the minimum FORMULA  to 50 km sFORMULA  removes the ensemble of low velocity stars from
the diagram, reducing the density and increasing the spread in FORMULA  for nearby
stars (Fig. REF , lower panel). Despite this difference, dynamically
generated runaways still display a clear peak in relative density at FORMULA 
10 kpc. Around this peak, stars have a median FORMULA  close to zero and a spread of
FORMULA 500 km sFORMULA  (Table 1).
Because the dynamical model yields a maximum FORMULA  800 km sFORMULA , a few
runaways reach larger distances and have larger radial velocities than
supernova-induced runaways. Despite this difference, very few runaways are
unbound (§).
Although 3 FORMULA  HVSs have a nearly identical distribution of ejection velocities
as 1 FORMULA  HVSs, the density distributions in the FORMULA –FORMULA  plane show several clear
differences. The primary peak in the density lies at somewhat smaller distances, at
FORMULA  8 kpc instead of FORMULA  10 kpc. The secondary peak falls at much smaller
distances, FORMULA  50 kpc instead of a few Mpc. The drop in density at large distances
is much more rapid, falling to zero just inside 1 Mpc instead of reaching to 30 Mpc.
These trends have simple physical explanations {{cite:ac11fc52-b852-42bb-99c9-2a06cc232b3e}}, {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}.
For our adopted MW potential and HVS parameters, roughly 10% of ejected stars
have velocities large enough to reach 10–20 kpc but too small to travel beyond
60–100 kpc. Typical travel times of 100–400 Myr for these bound stars are a
significant fraction of the main sequence lifetime of a 3 FORMULA  star, but are much
smaller than the lifetime of a 1 FORMULA  star. Bound stars with long lifetimes
have median velocities close to zero and modest velocity dispersions of
100–200 km sFORMULA . However, many bound stars with short lifetimes reach FORMULA 
30–60 kpc and evolve off the main sequence before returning to the solar circle.
Thus, there is a large deficit of bound, massive stars with negative radial velocity.
For 3 FORMULA  stars, this deficit leads to a median FORMULA  larger than zero and a
larger velocity dispersion than 1 FORMULA  HVSs (see also Table 1).
Among unbound stars, finite stellar lifetimes are also responsible for trends in
FORMULA  with distance. Stars with larger ejection velocities reach larger distances;
the median FORMULA  and dispersion in FORMULA  thus increase with FORMULA . Longer lifetimes
also enable stars to reach larger FORMULA . With a factor of 30 longer lifetime, the
1 FORMULA  stars reach 30 times larger distances than 3 FORMULA  stars (30 Mpc instead
of 1 Mpc).
The initial velocity distributions of HVSs and runaways produce the stark differences
in Figs. REF –REF . Among runaways ejected from 3–30 kpc in
the Galactic disk, nearly all have modest ejection velocities and remain
bound to the Galaxy (§5). Bound stars with modest ejection velocities reach
maximum distances of roughly 100 kpc before falling back into the Galaxy.
The small fraction of runaways which reach the halo have typical FORMULA 
10 kpc and FORMULA  100–150 km sFORMULA .

Radial Velocity and Proper Motion Histograms
The density plots in Figs. REF –REF  demonstrate the rich
behavior in the predicted FORMULA  and FORMULA  as a function of initial
conditions and stellar properties. To focus on predictions for large ensembles
of HVSs and runaways, we now consider the frequency distributions of FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for Galactic halo stars (FORMULA  30FORMULA ) in a discrete set of distance
bins. In these diagrams, color encodes distance (violet: FORMULA  10 kpc, blue:
10 kpc FORMULA  20 kpc, green: 20 kpc FORMULA  40 kpc, and orange: 40 kpc
FORMULA  80 kpc). Tables 1–3 summarize statistics for FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA  in each distance bin.
Fig. REF  shows the distributions of FORMULA  (left panels) and
FORMULA  (right panels) for 1 FORMULA  (upper panels) and 3 FORMULA  (lower panels)
HVSs. The trends of radial velocity with stellar mass and distance follow the
correlations in §REF  {{cite:ac11fc52-b852-42bb-99c9-2a06cc232b3e}}, {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}.
For 3 FORMULA  stars, the median radial velocity grows with increasing distance.
Among the more distant stars, there is a large tail of very high velocity stars
with FORMULA  1000 km sFORMULA . As distance decreases, a smaller and smaller
fraction of stars have high velocities. In the nearby sample with FORMULA  10 kpc,
nearly all stars have FORMULA  500 km sFORMULA .
For 1 FORMULA  stars, the trend of increasing median velocity with increasing
distance is much weaker (Table 1). For all FORMULA , the velocity dispersion and
inter-quartile range are smaller. Although the typical maximum velocity is
similar, a much smaller fraction of stars has FORMULA  1000 km sFORMULA .
The distributions of proper motion and tangential velocity reverse the trends
of the radial velocity (Tables 2–3; Fig. REF , right panels).
Distant HVSs moving radially away from the GC have small transverse components
of their space motion, leading to small tangential velocities and small proper
motions. As the distance decreases, the angle between the line-of-sight and the
velocity vector for an HVS grows, leading to larger and larger tangential
velocities. With FORMULA , nearby HVSs have much larger proper
motions than more distant HVSs (see also Fig. REF ). Although
geometry requires that the maximum FORMULA  exceed the maximum FORMULA , some nearby
HVSs have FORMULA  400–600 km sFORMULA  and FORMULA  30 milliarcsec yrFORMULA .
Trends in the radial velocity distributions for supernova-induced runaways
follow those of the HVSs (Fig. REF ; Table 1). More distant
runaways have a larger median radial velocity and a larger tail to very large
radial velocity {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}. At fixed distance, however,
the average and median velocities of runaways are much smaller than those of
HVSs. Typically, runaways are 100–500 km sFORMULA  slower than HVSs, with velocity
dispersions less than half the dispersions of HVSs.
Differences between the radial velocity distributions for HVSs and runaways in
the snapshots
reflect the initial distribution of ejection velocities. As summarized in
§, more than 20% of the HVSs ejected with initial velocities
exceeding 600 km sFORMULA  reach the halo. Most HVSs that reach the halo are unbound.
The fastest runaways receive a boost from Galactic rotation (eq. [REF ]);
they all lie in the Galactic plane {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}. Many fewer
runaways reach the halo; nearly all of these have much smaller space velocities
than HVSs. As a result, runaways in the halo have smaller median radial velocities
and a larger fraction of bound stars than HVSs.
At similar distances, the proper motion distribution of both types of runaways is
broader than that of HVSs (Fig. REF , right panels). As with HVSs,
nearby runaways have larger tangential velocities than more distant runaways.
However, galactic rotation produces a double-peaked distribution of proper motion
for runaways at fixed distance (Fig. REF –REF ). In an
ensemble of stars with a broad range of distances, the double-peaked character of
the distribution smears out into a single broad peak. Among stars with a smaller
range of distances, the double-peaked proper motion distribution is prominent.
The distributions of FORMULA  and FORMULA  for runaways produced from dynamical ejections
have the same features as supernova-induced runaways. The median radial velocity
grows with distance (Fig. REF , left panels). Although dynamical
ejections produce a smaller fraction of high velocity runaways, the largest ejection
velocities exceed those produced from the supernova mechanism (Table 1). For
calculations with a minimum ejection velocity of 20 km sFORMULA , dynamical ejections yield
average and median velocities 5%–10% smaller than supernova-induced runaways. In
simulations with a minimum ejection velocity of 50 km sFORMULA , the inter-quartile ranges
and standard deviations for dynamical ejections lie between those of HVSs and runaways
produced in supernovae.
The larger maximum velocities from dynamical ejections shift the peaks of the proper
motion distributions to larger values (Fig. REF , right panels; see
also Table 3). These peaks are also somewhat broader than those for other ejected stars.
As with HVSs and supernova-induced runaways, the width of the proper motion distribution
narrows with increasing distance.
For 3 FORMULA  HVSs and runaways, GAIA can detect the typical proper motion in the FORMULA  =
40–80 kpc bins (dashed lines in Figs. REF –REF ).
To establish this conclusion, we use the predicted rms errors of roughly 0.16 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  for
stars with FORMULA  20 {{cite:7ad76de8-041f-4a2b-a418-b0b81a6d5fbd}}. Observed proper motions of 0.50 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  should
then be detectable at the 3FORMULA  level. Although solar-type stars with FORMULA  20
have FORMULA  10 kpc, 3 FORMULA  B-type stars with FORMULA  20 have FORMULA  100 kpc
(see also §7). Thus, reliable distances and proper motions from GAIA can test these
predicted proper motion distributions.
As we described in §REF , proper motion distributions for HVSs and runaways
are very sensitive to stellar lifetime. Long-lived unbound stars travel great distances
from the Galaxy; shorter-lived stars evolve off the main sequence before leaving the
Galaxy. Long-lived bound stars generate fairly symmetric distributions around the GC;
shorter-lived stars have more asymmetric distributions.
At high galactic latitude (FORMULA  30FORMULA ), HVSs provide the most extreme examples
of this behavior (Fig. REF , top panels). With lifetimes of 10 Gyr,
unbound 1 FORMULA  stars reach maximum distances of roughly 30 Mpc from the GC. These
unbound stars produce the prominent peak at FORMULA  0.01–0.05 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  in the
upper left panel of Fig. REF . Bound 1 FORMULA  stars have maximum distances
of roughly 60 kpc; they orbit the GC with periods of 700 Myr or less. Smaller
distances result in much larger proper motions. These stars comprise the smaller
peak in the upper left histogram at FORMULA  1–10 milliarcsec yrFORMULA .
Among all HVS ejections, bound stars outnumber unbound stars by roughly 4:1 (§5).
Outside the Galactic plane (FORMULA  30FORMULA ), however, unbound stars dominate.
Thus, the peak of unbound stars at small FORMULA  is larger than the peak of bound
stars at large FORMULA .
Despite having similar ejection velocities as low mass HVSs, massive unbound
HVSs do not live long enough to reach large distances from the GC. With typical
maximum distances of roughly 1 Mpc, the smallest proper motions of unbound
3 FORMULA  HVSs are roughly a factor of 30 larger than those of unbound
1 FORMULA  HVSs. Although there are a few massive HVSs with FORMULA 
0.03–0.10 milliarcsec yrFORMULA , most have FORMULA  0.1 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . These stars lie within the
peak at FORMULA  1 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  in the upper right panel of Fig. REF .
At FORMULA  30FORMULA , bound 3 FORMULA  HVSs have a much larger range in proper
motion. Marginally bound stars reach large distances from the GC, FORMULA 
40–60 kpc. Before they turn around and return to the GC, these stars evolve off
the main sequence. This group has fairly small proper motion FORMULA  1 milliarcsec yrFORMULA .
Among the much larger group of bound stars that reach small distances,
FORMULA  10–20 kpc, some have FORMULA  30FORMULA . These have large proper
motions, FORMULA  10 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . In between, stars with FORMULA  20–40 kpc
fill in the histogram at FORMULA  1–10 milliarcsec yrFORMULA .
These general conclusions apply to both types of runaways. Among stars ejected by
dynamical processes, a few have ejection velocities of 600–900 km sFORMULA  and can
reach large distances from the Galaxy. Low mass stars in this group are still
on the main sequence at FORMULA  1 Mpc; these stars produce a long tail in
the proper motion distribution at FORMULA  0.01–0.5 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  (Fig. REF , lower left panel). More massive stars cannot reach
these distances while on the main sequence; 3 FORMULA  unbound stars produce a small
shoulder in the distribution at FORMULA  0.1–0.3 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  (Fig. REF ,
upper right panel).
For all masses, the dynamical ejection process yields a large population of bound,
relatively nearby stars. Typical proper motions are FORMULA  1–20 milliarcsec yrFORMULA .
Nearly all stars in the peaks of both histograms are bound stars.
With much lower maximum ejection velocities, stars ejected during a supernova
are almost always bound to Galaxy. Among 1–3 FORMULA  stars, most are nearby.
Few have FORMULA  0.5 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . These stars simply produce a single peak
in the histogram at FORMULA  3–4 milliarcsec yrFORMULA .
At large FORMULA , the shapes of all of the histograms are fairly similar. For
all of our snapshots, nearby stars with high velocity are rare. Most runaways
with FORMULA  1 kpc have small velocities and modest proper motions. HVSs
fill a much larger volume of the Galaxy and have much smaller space densities.
Thus, the frequency of ejected stars with FORMULA  10 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  falls sharply
and reaches zero at FORMULA  100 milliarcsec yrFORMULA .

Proper Motion in Galactic Coordinates
To conclude our analysis of complete snapshots of ejected stars, we focus on the
variation of proper motion with FORMULA  and FORMULA . After separating stars into four
galactic latitude bins equally spaced in FORMULA , we divide the FORMULA –FORMULA 
plane into a set of bins spaced by 0.01 in log FORMULA  and 1FORMULA  in FORMULA . As with the
FORMULA –FORMULA  and FORMULA –FORMULA  diagrams in §REF –REF ,
we plot the relative density of stars in each bin as a contour diagram where bright
red represents the largest density and dark blue represents the smallest density.
The range in density varies from a factor of 5–10 for 1 FORMULA  runaways to a factor
of 50–500 for 1–3 FORMULA  HVSs.
Fig. REF  shows a set of four contour diagrams for 3 FORMULA  HVSs.
At all FORMULA , HVSs have a broad range of proper motion between 0.1 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  and
30 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . Outside the GC region, the typical proper motion is FORMULA 
1 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . Towards the GC, there is a strong concentration of stars with large
proper motion, FORMULA  10–100 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . This concentration is strongest
at low Galactic latitude and weakens considerably at larger FORMULA .
In the Galactic plane (Fig. REF , lowermost panel), the variation
of FORMULA  with FORMULA  for HVSs shows a clear signature from the Sun's orbit around
the GC (see eq. [REF ]; compare with Fig. REF ).
The plot shows clear minima in FORMULA  at FORMULA  = FORMULA 100FORMULA  and at FORMULA  = FORMULA 80FORMULA .
The Sun's (i) spatial offset
from the GC and (ii) orbit around the GC produces the lack of mirror symmetry in
the minima (see also Fig. REF ). At somewhat larger FORMULA  (middle
two panels), the amplitude of the variation is visible but suppressed. Towards
the Galactic poles (uppermost panel), the Sun's position and orbital velocity
have no impact on the tangential velocity. Thus, the variation disappears.
Contour diagrams for supernova-induced runaways display identical features
(Fig. REF ). Runaways have somewhat larger proper motions
than HVSs, with a typical FORMULA  3 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  and a typical range of
0.3–30 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . Although HVSs have larger space velocities, their much
larger distances result in smaller proper motions.
As with HVSs, the contour diagrams change systematically with Galactic latitude.
In the Galactic plane (Fig. REF , lowermost panel), runaways
display a large concentration of high proper motion stars towards the GC.
At larger FORMULA , this concentration weakens and spreads to a broader range of
Galactic longitude. High velocity runaways outside the solar circle but close
to the Galactic plane also show clear minima in FORMULA  at FORMULA  FORMULA 110FORMULA  and
FORMULA 100FORMULA . As noted for high velocity HVS in Fig. REF , these
minima are a clear signature of solar rotation around the GC and the solar
offset from the GC (see Fig. REF ).
This signal gradually diminishes with increasing FORMULA .
A clear minimum in FORMULA  at FORMULA  0 and FORMULA  0.25
(Fig. REF , lowermost panel) distinguishes supernova-induced runaways
from HVSs. For stars inside the solar circle, this feature is the signature of stars
rotating in the Galactic disk (see Fig. REF ). Inside the solar
circle, the tangential velocities of stars orbiting the GC lie in an egg-shaped
locus with FORMULA  2 FORMULA  and FORMULA  0. The lower edge
of this egg produces the distinct minimum in FORMULA  at FORMULA  0.
Dynamical runaways with a minimum velocity of 20 km sFORMULA  produce distributions of
FORMULA  nearly identical to the distributions for supernova-induced runaways
in Fig REF . Calculations with a minimum velocity of 50 km sFORMULA  yield
dramatically different results (Fig. REF ). Although (i) the typical
range in FORMULA , (ii) the heavy concentration of stars towards the GC, and (iii)
the clear minima in FORMULA  at FORMULA  100FORMULA  observed for dynamical runaways
are similar to results for supernova-induced runaways, there is
(i) a clear lack of stars with very small FORMULA  at FORMULA  0FORMULA  and
(ii) a broad minimum of stars with very small FORMULA  at FORMULA 150–180FORMULA .
The higher minimum ejection velocity in these calculations produces both features.
Stars on unperturbed orbits around the GC produce the distinct minimum in FORMULA 
at FORMULA  0FORMULA . Setting a high minimum ejection velocity in our calculations
produces ensembles of stars with modest tangential velocities and proper motions at
FORMULA  0FORMULA , eliminating the pronounced minimum in FORMULA  at FORMULA  = 0FORMULA  in
Fig. REF . This high minimum ejection velocity also tends to place
stars onto orbits with modest eccentricity. Stars originating inside the solar
circle – where the stellar density is large – then spend some time
outside the solar circle – where the stellar density is small. This behavior increases
the density of stars with small proper motion in the direction of the Galactic
anti-center, where the tangential velocity is very small (see Fig. REF ).

Summary
Analyzing the complete sample of stars in simulations of HVSs and runaways leads to
several clear results.

Ejections produce a broad range in FORMULA  (0–1000 km sFORMULA ), FORMULA  (0–600 km sFORMULA ),
and FORMULA  (0.01–100 milliarcsec yrFORMULA ). HVSs have the largest velocities and proper motions
(Figs. REF –REF ).

For distant stars, radial velocities separate unbound stars from bound stars
(Figs. REF –REF  and Figs. REF –REF ).

For nearby stars, proper motions distinguish between unbound stars and bound stars
on radial or circular orbits. However, nearby unbound stars are relatively rare compared
to nearby bound stars (Figs. REF –REF  and Fig. REF ).

Unbound runaways retain memory of their original orbital velocity around the GC.
At large distances and high Galactic latitudes, the double-peaked proper motion
distribution of runaways distinguishes them from stars on radial orbits
(Figs. REF –REF ).

In the Galactic plane, HVSs and runaways have clear, distinctive minima in FORMULA 
at FORMULA 100FORMULA  (Figs. REF –REF ).

Concentrations of high proper motion stars towards the GC are a unique signature
of HVSs ejected from the GC or runaways ejected from the inner galaxy
(Figs. REF –REF ).

GAIA can detect predicted proper motions of B-type HVSs and runaways with
FORMULA  100 kpc (Figs. REF –REF ).

These results clearly demonstrate the ability of radial velocity measurements to
distinguish the highest velocity HVSs and runaways from indigenous halo stars
{{cite:da966684-58e6-4be7-a265-cd5f0a5bf049}}, {{cite:16e8ab2b-c743-4651-9a1a-0adf4133588e}}, {{cite:ac11fc52-b852-42bb-99c9-2a06cc232b3e}}, {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}, {{cite:c0fc5352-e9ce-44cc-adcf-e60cbc2085de}}, {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}.
For HVSs and runaways with FORMULA  50–100 kpc, the median radial velocity,
500–600 km sFORMULA , and radial velocity dispersion, FORMULA  200–400 km sFORMULA , are
very different from the population of halo stars with median FORMULA  close to zero
and FORMULA  100–110 km sFORMULA . Thus, radial velocity surveys easily separate
the highest velocity HVSs and runaways from indigenous halo stars.
Among stars with intermediate distances, FORMULA  20–40 kpc, proper motions
can distinguish runaways from indigenous halo stars. For runaway stars with a
small range of distances, galactic rotation produces a clearly double-peaked
distribution of proper motions. With little or no rotation about the GC
{{cite:95f21129-446d-4bac-8b22-034e5d08d751}}, halo stars should have a broad, single-peaked distribution.
Because HVSs are ejected on purely radial orbits, their distribution of
proper motions should resemble the halo distribution.
Among nearby halo stars with FORMULA  10 kpc and FORMULA  30FORMULA ,
kinematic data do not offer a simple path for identifying ejected stars.
The velocity dispersions, FORMULA  100–175 km sFORMULA , of nearby HVSs
and runaways are comparable to the typical velocity dispersion of halo stars
{{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}. Thus, it is not possible
to use FORMULA  to distinguish nearby HVSs and runaways from halo stars. Although
the dispersions in FORMULA  for nearby HVSs and runaways are small, the median
FORMULA  250 km sFORMULA  for HVSs and dynamically generated runaways is much
larger than the roughly 150 km sFORMULA  dispersion in FORMULA  expected for indigenous
halo stars. Because nearby HVSs and runaways are rare, their proper motions
are fairly similar to the proper motions of nearby halo stars.
As with radial velocities, obvious outliers in proper motion are promising
candidates for ejected stars. Our simulations yield maximum proper motions
of 100 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  for stars with FORMULA  1–2 kpc. Along any line-of-sight,
however, such high proper motion stars comprise only 0.01–0.1% of the
complete population of ejected stars. Thus, high proper motion outliers
should be very rare.

DISTANCE LIMITED SAMPLES OF STARS
To construct a clear set of testable predictions from the simulations, we now focus on
distance-limited (magnitude-limited) samples of 1 FORMULA  and 3 FORMULA  HVSs and runaways.
Based on the expected sensitivity of GAIA, we establish a magnitude limit. For
convenience, we base this limit on the SDSS FORMULA  magnitude {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}.
Using stellar evolution models, we convert the magnitude limit into a distance limit
FORMULA . Finally, we draw stars with FORMULA  from the complete simulations
of HVSs and runaways. These catalogs allow us to predict distributions of FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for comparison with observations.
For 1–3 FORMULA  stars with FORMULA  20, GAIA observations should yield proper
motions with rms errors of 0.16 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  {{cite:7ad76de8-041f-4a2b-a418-b0b81a6d5fbd}}, {{cite:afdfc8f7-4f8e-498d-b643-f4fb5a54e615}}. Brighter
stars have much smaller errors, roughly 0.08 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  for FORMULA  19 and 0.05 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  for
FORMULA  18. Because GAIA should detect proper motions of roughly 0.15–0.5 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  for
stars with FORMULA  18–20, we set a magnitude limit of FORMULA  = 20.
To convert this magnitude limit to a distance limit, we derive absolute magnitudes
FORMULA  from the Padova stellar evolution models. For solar metallicity
{{cite:17fbab9a-1044-419f-bdeb-9bf59dfb457a}}, FORMULA (1 FORMULA ) = 5.1 at FORMULA  = 5 Gyr and
FORMULA (3 FORMULA ) = 0.17 at FORMULA  = 172.5 Myr. These ages are half of the adopted main-sequence
lifetimes of 10 Gyr and 345 Myr for these stars {{cite:17fbab9a-1044-419f-bdeb-9bf59dfb457a}}. These
magnitudes then yield distance limits of FORMULA  = 9.55 kpc (92.5 kpc) for an ensemble of
middle-aged 1 FORMULA  (3 FORMULA ) stars. We round these limits to 10 kpc for
1 FORMULA  stars and 100 kpc for 3 FORMULA  stars.
In this first exploration of distance-limited samples of HVSs and runaways
from our simulations, we ignore
several aspects of stellar evolution and Galactic structure. We assume stars are
unreddened, which is reasonable for halo stars at high galactic latitude
{{cite:497fc68d-7e55-478c-87f3-63b8ee36315b}}. Although metallicity has a small impact (FORMULA  0.1 mag)
on FORMULA  for 3 FORMULA  stars, these stars brighten by roughly 1 mag during their main
sequence lifetime {{cite:17fbab9a-1044-419f-bdeb-9bf59dfb457a}}. For ensembles of 1 FORMULA  stars, metallicity and
stellar evolution produce a 0.5–0.75 mag spread in FORMULA  {{cite:17fbab9a-1044-419f-bdeb-9bf59dfb457a}}. Thus,
FORMULA  = 20 3 FORMULA  (1 FORMULA ) main sequence stars with a range of ages and metallicities
have a 10% to 20% range in distances. This range is small compared to the obvious
trends in FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  with FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  derived from our simulations.
Thus, we can safely adopt uniform samples of identical stars with no range in age or
metallicity.
Fig. REF  compares predicted density distributions in the FORMULA –FORMULA 
plane for distance-limited samples of HVSs (left panels) and runaways (right panels).
Contours for 1 FORMULA  (3 FORMULA ) stars are in the upper (lower) panels. For
simplicity, we show results for 1 FORMULA  supernova-induced runaways and for
3 FORMULA  dynamically generated runaways. Density distributions for other runaway
models have similar morphology to those shown in this diagram.
The loci for 1 FORMULA  HVSs and runaways are fairly similar. Compared to the set
of contours for 3 FORMULA  stars in the lower panels, both ensembles have a limited
extent in radial velocity and proper motion, with FORMULA  FORMULA 250 km sFORMULA  to
FORMULA 250 km sFORMULA  and FORMULA  1–30 milliarcsec yrFORMULA .
The HVS contours have a broader extent in FORMULA  and a much narrower extent in FORMULA 
than the contours for the runaways. The median proper motion of roughly 6 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  for
1 FORMULA  HVSs is somewhat larger than the median proper motion of 5 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  for
1 FORMULA  runaways.
The ensemble of 3 FORMULA  ejected stars fills a much larger portion of FORMULA –FORMULA 
space. HVSs and runaways have a large concentration of bound stars with median
FORMULA  close to 0 km sFORMULA  and median proper motion of roughly 3–10 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . Both
populations contain a group of unbound stars with larger FORMULA  and smaller FORMULA .
Among the runaways, this group produces a modest `tail' in the distribution which
comprises less than 0.1% of the entire population. For HVSs, however, the tail
extends to FORMULA  1000–1500 km sFORMULA  and contains more than half of the
ensemble. Nearly all of the unbound HVSs have small proper motion, FORMULA 
1 milliarcsec yrFORMULA .
To compare the distributions of proper motion and radial velocity in more detail,
Fig. REF  shows histograms of radial velocity (left panels) and
proper motion (right panels) for 1 FORMULA  (upper panels) and 3 FORMULA  (lower panels)
ejected stars. The radial velocity histograms for 1 FORMULA  stars in the upper left
panel are amazingly similar with clear peaks at roughly FORMULA 50 km sFORMULA  and modest
velocity dispersions. In this group, supernova-induced runaways have the smallest
velocity dispersion, FORMULA  103 km sFORMULA . HVSs have a somewhat smaller velocity
dispersion, FORMULA  138 km sFORMULA , than the dynamically generated runaways, FORMULA 
172 km sFORMULA  (Table 1).
Proper motion distributions for different types of 1 FORMULA  ejected stars are also
very similar (Fig. REF , upper right panel). The HVSs have a sharp peak
at 5–10 milliarcsec yrFORMULA ; nearly all 1 FORMULA  HVSs have FORMULA  3–30 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . Runaways
produced during a supernova have a broader distribution displaced to smaller FORMULA .
The median FORMULA  is roughly 50% smaller; the dispersion is roughly 25% larger (Table 3).
Dynamically generated runaways have median FORMULA  comparable to the HVSs and a 40%
larger dispersion. Thus, the distribution of dynamically generated runaways extends
to much larger FORMULA  than the HVSs.
The FORMULA  distributions for 3 FORMULA  stars are much easier to distinguish
(Fig. REF , lower left panel).
Supernova-induced runaways have a very narrow radial velocity distribution with a
median near zero velocity and a dispersion of roughly 100 km sFORMULA  (see also Table 1).
Dynamically generated runaways also have a median velocity near zero and a larger
dispersion of 170 km sFORMULA . In contrast, 3 FORMULA  HVSs have a much larger median,
FORMULA  200 km sFORMULA , and dispersion, FORMULA  300–350 km sFORMULA . More than 1% of the HVSs have
radial velocities exceeding 1000 km sFORMULA , compared to 0% for both types of runaways.
The proper motion distributions of ejected 3 FORMULA  stars also show a clear
separation (Fig. REF , lower right panel). Most high velocity HVSs
lie at large distances and have small proper motions, producing a clear peak in
the proper motion histogram at roughly 1 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . The distance limit establishes
the sharp drop in the population at smaller FORMULA . A few nearby HVSs have maximum
proper motions of 30–50 milliarcsec yrFORMULA .
Most 3 FORMULA  runaways have much larger proper motions than 3 FORMULA  HVSs.
Stars ejected during a supernova have a fairly symmetric distribution of FORMULA ,
with a median at 3–5 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  and a dispersion of roughly 3–4 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . The
dynamical ejections produce a broader peak with a larger median at roughly
8–9 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . Compared to the supernova-induced runaways, there are fewer
dynamically generated runaways with FORMULA  3–5 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  and more with
FORMULA  1–2 milliarcsec yrFORMULA .

OBSERVATIONAL TESTS
The distance-limited samples suggest several clear tests of the models based
on existing samples of ejected stars. Among 3 FORMULA  stars, HVS models predict
a much larger group of stars with large FORMULA  compared to either model for
runaways. Because these stars lie at larger distances than runaways, HVSs
should also have much smaller proper motions.
Among 1 FORMULA  stars, the models predict a large overlap in the observed
FORMULA  and FORMULA . Despite this large overlap, it might be possible to isolate
HVSs and dynamically generated runaways within a large sample of halo stars.
The observed radial velocity dispersion of halo stars
{{cite:24068215-02d5-431f-bc1d-0a2f44abfdfc}}, {{cite:cedad227-da0f-4023-b83b-8b53283eabf7}}, {{cite:c7a15263-da2e-4baf-9ad4-c05e21deb34d}}, {{cite:0a4f4cb5-4bec-4455-8d87-53da6bc4fa18}}, {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}
is somewhat smaller than the predicted velocity dispersion – 140–170  km sFORMULA  – of
HVSs and dynamically generated runaways. Large samples of stars might also provide
a distinction between the narrow proper motion distribution predicted for HVSs
from the broader distribution predicted for runaways.
To begin to investigate these possibilities, we consider several sets of ejected
stars derived from the SDSS. For 1 FORMULA  stars, we examine candidates drawn from
the G–K dwarfs in SEGUE {{cite:51f9b2ff-2407-4d68-b93b-a706105f543b}}. The candidates have a broad range in
brightness FORMULA  14–20. The large surface density of G–K dwarfs results in
a sample of more than 28,000 stars with moderate resolution spectroscopy and high
quality radial velocities and atmospheric parameters. From this ensemble,
{{cite:41e37042-4770-45ef-8052-beeba6dd5325}} use SDSS proper motion data to select 20 stars with
FORMULA  1–6 kpc, FORMULA  10–100 milliarcsec yrFORMULA , and FORMULA 
FORMULA  km sFORMULA  to FORMULA  km sFORMULA . Most of these candidates are metal-poor, with
FORMULA  FORMULA  to FORMULA  and modest enhancements of FORMULA 
nuclei relative to Fe.
To compare with models for 3 FORMULA  stars, we focus on the targeted search for HVSs
from {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}. This set of FORMULA  20 HVS candidates derives from a nearly
complete spectroscopic survey of 1126 candidate B-type main sequence stars with
FORMULA  17–20.25 selected from the SDSS {{cite:557b1297-1cce-4277-a90c-d92ff3810f96}}. Moderate resolution
MMT spectra yield high quality radial velocities (FORMULA  250–800 km sFORMULA ),
atmospheric parameters (log FORMULA  3.75–4.6 and FORMULA  10000–14000 K),
and distances (FORMULA  40–100 kpc). For a few candidates, high resolution spectra
confirm their main sequence nature and yield stronger constraints on the atmospheric
parameters {{cite:f605b0fd-5c29-4d66-8c50-dd227a7c1959}}, {{cite:67de0ba8-3f62-4512-99ae-32a3a67375aa}}, {{cite:d3322b96-457e-49ef-ba1d-0796faeb5b5b}}, {{cite:d09419dd-5f0f-434b-947e-7dd876d589ac}}.
To compare simulations with a sample of likely runaway stars, we select 16 runaway
main sequence stars with high Galactic latitude and masses of 2.5–4.0 FORMULA  {{cite:c0fc5352-e9ce-44cc-adcf-e60cbc2085de}}.
Although derived from several surveys, this set of stars has reliable distances,
radial velocities, proper motions, and atmospheric parameters.
With FORMULA  250 km sFORMULA  and FORMULA  5 kpc, these runaways are closer
and have much smaller space velocities than the HVS candidates. The accurate proper
motions allow us to test whether the lack of proper motion information for the HVS
candidates limits our ability to compare their radial velocity distributuon with
our simulations.
To test the simulations in more detail, we examine a handful of miscellaneous
high velocity main sequence stars identified in other surveys. In order of
increasing mass, these stars are:
SDSS J013655.91+242546.0, a 2.5 FORMULA  A-type sequence star with FORMULA  11 kpc
and FORMULA  325 km sFORMULA  {{cite:07c61e3a-c5b7-466e-b5e4-676f52787c8d}};
HIP 60350, a 5 FORMULA  B-type main sequence star with FORMULA  3 kpc and
FORMULA  260 km sFORMULA  {{cite:98fd8023-0fee-4327-b4fe-e59eba772e87}};
HE0437-5439, a 9 FORMULA  B-type star close to the LMC with FORMULA  61 kpc
and FORMULA  725 km sFORMULA  {{cite:edaad942-4547-4cc1-a40d-a37fc99a72d9}};
HD 271791, an 11 FORMULA  B-type main sequence star with FORMULA  21 kpc and
FORMULA  440 km sFORMULA  {{cite:b422dfca-b432-400a-8eb6-7ded2846ac95}}; and
J091206.52+091621.8, another 11 FORMULA  B-type main sequence star with
FORMULA  13 kpc and FORMULA  620 km sFORMULA  {{cite:a83467b7-faa9-470a-95eb-82d2aeb44ff3}}. Selected in
a variety of ways, this group of stars has reliable distances, space motions,
and atmospheric properties. As with the runaways, the additional proper motion
information yields a good test of our calculations.
Finally, we consider how well proper motion and radial velocity data isolate
HVSs and runaways from samples of indigenous halo stars. For this study, we
include data from recent surveys of halo stars towards the north Galactic
pole {{cite:0265e611-725f-4288-bb04-36991e1d2a03}} and the Galactic anti-center {{cite:5af53939-7edc-4558-a71d-45d5c25c7685}}.
Selected from several surveys, the RR Lyr stars have measured pulsation
periods and metallicities; the blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars have no
metallicity data. Both groups have proper motion and radial velocity
measurements with typical uncertainties of a few milliarcsec yrFORMULA  and 10 km sFORMULA .
With FORMULA  100–125 confirmed halo stars in each sample, these data enable
a first comparison between observations of halo stars and our calculations.
Surveys of solar-type stars
Fig. REF  compares the HVS candidates from {{cite:41e37042-4770-45ef-8052-beeba6dd5325}}
with predictions from the HVS and supernova-induced runaway models. Solid
lines show contours of constant stellar density which contain 50% (inner)
and 90% (outer) of the stars in the complete samples of simulated stars.
Contours for dynamically generated runaways are nearly identical to those
for the supernova-induced runaways. Filled circles indicate the measured
(FORMULA ) for the HVS candidates.
Based on this comparison, the HVS model and both runaway models are wildly
inconsistent with the observations. Although the observed radial velocities fall
within the bounds predicted for all three models, the observed proper motions
lie well above model predictions. None of the survey stars fall within the
50% contours of any model; only 3 fall within the 90% contours. Using the
95% contours (not shown on the Fig.), the runaway models fare a little better
than the HVS model, with 5 (instead of 3) stars lying within the contours.
Despite this marginally better success, all models are excluded at better than
3FORMULA  confidence.
There are two possible origins of the mismatch between the models and the
observations in Fig. REF . Reducing the proper motions by
a factor of 5 would place the data within the 50% contours of all models.
Although {{cite:41e37042-4770-45ef-8052-beeba6dd5325}} derive high reliabilities for their proper motion
measurements, the ratio of the transverse to radial velocity for this sample
is much larger than expected for a random selection of high velocity stars.
Thus, there is a reasonable probability that at least some of the large
proper motions are spurious {{cite:41e37042-4770-45ef-8052-beeba6dd5325}}. Testing this hypothesis with
another epoch of imaging data from the ground or with GAIA is straightforward.
The only alternative to explain the large proper motions of these stars is to
develop another model which produces high velocity stars. Modifying the existing HVS
or runaway models is unlikely to produce a better match: the geometry of ejections
from the GC or the Galactic disk simply precludes a large population of nearby
1 FORMULA  stars with modest radial velocity and very large proper motions. Supernova-induced
runaways from binaries in the halo might allow a better match; however, supernova
rates for halo binaries are probably much smaller than those in the disk. The
{{cite:28e59962-f2df-4a19-9bce-22f541eab117}} proposal of ejections from disrupted dwarf galaxies requires a
somewhat massive Milky Way, FORMULA  1.5–2 FORMULA  FORMULA , but seems
otherwise plausible. Numerical simulations of the velocity distribution of stars
from disrupted dwarfs are required to test this interesting idea in more detail but
are beyond the scope of this paper.

Surveys of B-type stars
Fig. REF  compares the HVS candidates from {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}
with predictions from the HVS and runaway models. As in Fig. REF ,
solid lines show contours of stellar density which contain 50% (inner) and 90%
(outer) of the stars in each simulation. Filled circles indicate the measured
(FORMULA ) for the HVS candidates. Unlike the 1 FORMULA  targets, these candidates
lie close to or within the 90% contours for all three models.
This comparison strongly favors the HVS model for the origin of these high
velocity stars. Only one (four) of the candidates lies within the 90% contour
for the supernova-induced (dynamically generated) runaway model. Nearly all
lie beyond the 95% contours (not shown on the Fig.). In contrast, more than
half of the candidates lie within the 50% contour for the HVS model; all lie
within the 90% contour. Taking the results at face value, this comparison
rules out the runaway models at better than 3FORMULA  confidence.
To test the models in another way, we attempt to match the observed FORMULA  and
FORMULA  of the candidates from the complete ensemble of stars in the HVS and
runaway models. For each HVS candidate with Galactic coordinates (FORMULA ),
we select all model stars within a 20FORMULA  FORMULA  20FORMULA  window centered
on the measured coordinates. Among this group, we count the number of model
stars with distances and radial velocities within 10% of the measurements
and tabulate the number of `matches' FORMULA  for each candidate.
Fig. REF  summarizes the results of this matching exercise. For
each survey star, the bars show FORMULA  for the HVS (violet) and dynamically
generated runaway (cyan) models. With only one match among all HVS candidates,
the supernova-induced runaway model fails the exercise. The HVS and dynamical
runaway models fare much better, with FORMULA  30–100 for the HVS model
and FORMULA  1–10 for the runaway model.
Based on this approach, we conclude with strong confidence that the candidate
HVSs from the {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}} survey are much more likely to be HVSs ejected
from the GC than runaway stars ejected from the Galactic disk. For every survey
star, the HVS model yields a larger FORMULA  with FORMULA 
10–100 FORMULA . Factor of two changes in the size of the windows
for the distance, galactic coordinates, and radial velocity in the matching
algorithm yield indistinguishable results. Among all HVS candidates, the
supernova-induced runaway model yields 0–1 matches. Analyzing each candidate
separately, an ensemble of HVSs ejected from the GC always produces a factor of
10–100 more matches than an ensemble of runaways generated from dynamical
interactions.
Modest changes to the probability distribution for the ejection velocity of
runaways cannot change this conclusion. Matching the observed radial velocities
of the 3 FORMULA  HVS candidates requires much larger maximum ejection velocities
(e.g., 800 km sFORMULA  instead of our adopted 400 km sFORMULA ) for supernova-induced ejections
or a much shallower power-law distribution of ejection velocities (e.g.,
FORMULA , with FORMULA  2 instead of our adopted 8/3)
for dynamically generated runaways. Although doubling the maximum velocity from a
supernova ejection is possible in rare circumstances {{cite:690aca52-b962-4b1a-8826-03ec6db0cc88}},
observations suggest a maximum ejection velocity of 400–450 km sFORMULA , close to our
adopted value {{cite:c0fc5352-e9ce-44cc-adcf-e60cbc2085de}}. Observations also appear to preclude
placing a larger fraction of runaways at the highest velocities {{cite:c0fc5352-e9ce-44cc-adcf-e60cbc2085de}}.

Runaway B-type Stars
Fig. REF  compares the runaways from {{cite:c0fc5352-e9ce-44cc-adcf-e60cbc2085de}} with
predictions from the HVS and runaway models. As in Fig. REF ,
solid lines show contours of stellar density which contain 50% (inner) and 90%
(outer) of the stars in each simulation. Filled circles indicate the measured
(FORMULA ) for the runaway candidates; these stars lie close to or within the
90% contours for all three models.
This comparison strongly favors the runaway model. Only two candidates lie
within the 90% contour for the HVSs model; none lie within the 50% contour.
Many of the candidates are close to or within contours from dynamically generated
runaways with a minimum ejection velocity of 50 km sFORMULA . More than half of the
candidates fall within the 90% contours of the supernova-induced runaway model.
Contours generated from a set of dynamically generated runaways with a minimum
ejection velocity of 20 km sFORMULA  show a similarly good agreement with the observations.
Our matching algorithm also favors the runaway model for these stars. Only one
star – EC 09452-1403 with FORMULA  = 236 km sFORMULA  – yields any matches (three) to
the HVS model. The supernova-induced runaway model typically yields 10–100
matches for each target.
To add a little more realism to the matching algorithm, we add the measured
proper motions. Requiring the proper motion in FORMULA  and FORMULA  to match within
FORMULA 10% eliminates all matches for the HVS model to data for EC 09452-1403.
Although including proper motion data also reduces the number of matches for
the supernova-induced runaway model, the typical number of matches is still
3–20 per star.
These tests demonstrate our ability to explain observations of bona-fide
runaways from a set of numerical simulations and to discriminate between HVSs
and runaways. The positions of these stars in the FORMULA  diagram and the number
of matches in FORMULA  space clearly favor an identification as runaways
rather than HVSs.

Miscellaneous High Velocity Stars
We now consider five miscellaneous high velocity stars identified as possible
HVSs or `hyper-runaways.' Here, we focus on two basic predictions from ejected
star models: (i) HVSs should have radial orbits from the GC and
(ii) runaways should have a significant non-radial component of motion
consistent with ejection from the disk.
From the observed FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA , we derive the radial velocity in the GC
frame and the predicted proper motion for a purely radial orbit (e.g.,
eq. [REF ] and eqs. [REF –REF ]). For nearby
HVS candidates, the tangential component of the velocity dominates the space
motion; for more distant HVSs, the radial component dominates. Among runaways,
the tangential component of the motion is smaller than HVS for nearby stars and
larger than HVS for more distant stars. If a nearby (distant) candidate is a
runaway, we expect the analytic proper motion to exceed (fall below) the observed
proper motion. In addition to yielding a reasonably simple way to distinguish
between HVSs and runaways, this approach avoids cpu-intensive calculations
for stars with masses of 2–11 FORMULA  which are not included in our suite of
simulations.
To test this approach, we derive predicted proper motions for HVS candidates
from {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}. Our analysis yields predictions of 0.3–1.2 milliarcsec yrFORMULA .
For each HVS candidate, we then compare this analytic proper motion with the
average proper motion from the simulated stars selected with the matching
algorithm outlined in §REF . The typical difference between the
analytic and numerical results is small, FORMULA  0.1–0.2 milliarcsec yrFORMULA , with a
dispersion of 0.5 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . Thus, the analytic approach works reasonably well.
This analysis strongly favors runaway models for SDSS J013655.91+242546.0,
HIP 60350, and HD 271791. For SDSS J013655.91+242546.0 and HD 271791, the
observed magnitude of the proper motion is much larger than predicted from
the simple HVS model. Coupled with the observed FORMULA , proper motions in
FORMULA  and FORMULA  strongly favor ejection from the disk instead of the GC
{{cite:b422dfca-b432-400a-8eb6-7ded2846ac95}}, {{cite:07c61e3a-c5b7-466e-b5e4-676f52787c8d}}. For HIP 60350, the HVS model
predicts much larger proper motion than observed. Proper motions in FORMULA  and
FORMULA  also favor a disk ejection {{cite:98fd8023-0fee-4327-b4fe-e59eba772e87}}.
For HE0437-5439 and J091206.52+091621.8, the small proper motions favor
HVS models. HE0437-5439 has a distance and radial velocity similar to
HVS-1 {{cite:da966684-58e6-4be7-a265-cd5f0a5bf049}}, {{cite:edaad942-4547-4cc1-a40d-a37fc99a72d9}}. HST proper motion data suggest origin
in the GC {{cite:41684234-05c4-4999-8e7b-abf86bd360cd}}; ejection from the LMC is also possible
{{cite:edaad942-4547-4cc1-a40d-a37fc99a72d9}}, {{cite:41684234-05c4-4999-8e7b-abf86bd360cd}}. For J091206.52+091621.8, the observed proper
motion is comparable to or less than the predicted proper motion of roughly
3 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  {{cite:a83467b7-faa9-470a-95eb-82d2aeb44ff3}}. However, the relatively large errors in the
proper motion prevent isolating the ejection solely from the GC {{cite:a83467b7-faa9-470a-95eb-82d2aeb44ff3}}.

Surveys of Halo Stars
To consider whether observations can distinguish HVSs and runaways from halo
stars, we examine kinematic measurements from {{cite:0265e611-725f-4288-bb04-36991e1d2a03}}, {{cite:5af53939-7edc-4558-a71d-45d5c25c7685}}.
Fig. REF  compares data for blue horizontal branch stars
(`BHB'; cyan points) and RR Lyr stars (`RR'; orange points) with model
contours for distance-limited samples of 3 FORMULA  HVSs (`HV3'; violet curves)
and runaways (`RS3'; green curves). The contours enclose 50% (inner)
and 95% (outer) of the stars in each simulation. To provide an approximate
match to the Galactic coordinates for halo stars in the upper (lower) panel,
we select HVSs and runaways with FORMULA  75FORMULA  (FORMULA  160FORMULA  to FORMULA  =
200FORMULA  and FORMULA  = 25FORMULA  to 50FORMULA ).
This comparison confirms our previous conclusion that radial velocity
measurements directly discriminate between HVSs and indigenous halo stars
{{cite:16e8ab2b-c743-4651-9a1a-0adf4133588e}}, {{cite:ac11fc52-b852-42bb-99c9-2a06cc232b3e}}, {{cite:5a836e1d-f556-4782-91ef-56719bc2610a}}, {{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}, {{cite:d77bb2f4-5e3c-4f67-afa9-2251dab9bffb}}, {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}, {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}. For FORMULA  FORMULA 200 km sFORMULA  to FORMULA 300 km sFORMULA ,
the distributions of halo stars and HVSs overlap. Beyond FORMULA 
300 km sFORMULA , however, HVSs dominate. This separation has a simple origin:
HVSs and halo stars with FORMULA  300 km sFORMULA  are bound to the
galaxy. HVSs with larger FORMULA  are unbound.
Although the radial velocity distributions for halo stars and runaways
overlap in the direction of the north Galactic pole (NGP), the highest
velocity runaways are easily distinguished from halo stars towards the
Galactic anti-center. At the NGP, nearly all runaways are bound to the
Galaxy. Thus, they have radial velocities similar to indigenous halo
stars. Towards the anti-center, the velocity from Galactic rotation
enables a significant population of unbound runaways on outbound
trajectories. Bound halo stars never reach the large FORMULA  of these
unbound runaways.
Proper motion data alone do not easily discriminate HVSs and runaways
from indigenous halo stars. The maximum proper motion of halo stars
in {{cite:0265e611-725f-4288-bb04-36991e1d2a03}}, {{cite:5af53939-7edc-4558-a71d-45d5c25c7685}}, FORMULA  30–50 milliarcsec yrFORMULA , exceeds the
proper motions of 99% (FORMULA  100%) of HVSs and runaways towards
the NGP (anti-center). Towards the anti-center, the number of high
proper motion outliers, FORMULA  100 milliarcsec yrFORMULA , is nearly zero.
Towards the NGP, however, 0.1–1% of HVSs and runaways have proper
motions larger than 100 milliarcsec yrFORMULA . Thus, occasional HVSs and runaways
can be identified as proper motion outliers {{cite:b422dfca-b432-400a-8eb6-7ded2846ac95}}, {{cite:07c61e3a-c5b7-466e-b5e4-676f52787c8d}}, {{cite:98fd8023-0fee-4327-b4fe-e59eba772e87}}.
For large samples of halo stars, accurate distances might provide a
way to isolate runaways from indigenous stars (Fig. REF ).
Because runaways share the rotation of stars in the disk, they should
exhibit a double-peaked distribution of proper motion. With little or
no rotation {{cite:95f21129-446d-4bac-8b22-034e5d08d751}}, indigenous halo stars should
have a single-peaked distribution. Although synthesizing the expected
distribution for indigenous halo stars is beyond our scope, isolating
the runaways probably requires a significant population of ejected
stars within the halo.

Ejection Rates
To complete our comparisons between the models and available data, we now estimate
the relative production rates for HVSs and runaways. Accurate rate estimates
allow us to predict the relative space density of ejected stars as a function
of distance and Galactic latitude {{cite:d77bb2f4-5e3c-4f67-afa9-2251dab9bffb}}, {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}.
Because the matching algorithm and the contour maps draw from equal numbers
of simulated HVSs and runaways, production rates allow us to normalize the
number of matches to the expected space density.
Predictions for HVSs depend on the rate binaries encounter the black hole
at the GC {{cite:0ba1e729-7b30-423c-a659-799c37a29194}}. The time variation of the population of
binaries within the `loss cone' – the ensemble of orbits which pass within
the black hole's tidal radius – is an important issue in these derivations.
Binary encounters with the black hole empty the loss cone; encounters between
binaries and molecular clouds or other field stars fill the loss cone
{{cite:0ba1e729-7b30-423c-a659-799c37a29194}}, {{cite:30e284b9-eb50-4c3e-bbd7-94bb15117648}}, {{cite:0ac4b5d3-d731-4410-bd52-6a23438706d0}}, {{cite:771e8522-16e3-4492-b593-6acae8abc7d3}}, {{cite:d48cfaa8-402d-40c8-bd56-20af11b6b3b1}}. Rates with a
`full' loss cone are larger than those with an `empty' loss cone; typical
estimates are FORMULA  yrFORMULA  for binaries of all types
{{cite:0ba1e729-7b30-423c-a659-799c37a29194}}, {{cite:3a152766-a5d5-4da5-b94e-4c761c955517}}, {{cite:0ac4b5d3-d731-4410-bd52-6a23438706d0}}. For reasonable initial mass
functions, limiting the binary population to 2.5–3.5 FORMULA  B-type stars
(0.8–1.2 FORMULA  G-type stars) implies rates 40 times (10 times) smaller,
2.5–250 FORMULA  yrFORMULA  for B-type stars and
1–100 FORMULA  yrFORMULA  for G-type stars.
To infer empirical HVS rates, we focus on the S stars at the GC
{{cite:75436a39-7047-4977-902e-320381f9d681}}, {{cite:1f307c7b-ebc4-452d-aacd-8b43202438b2}} and HVSs in the Galactic halo {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}.
The S stars are luminous B-type stars orbiting the GC which are the
plausible captured partners of HVSs ejected into the outer Galaxy
{{cite:1bb5fc5f-37f6-4bb8-871f-20cc21e872da}}, {{cite:c1c95cac-5cd0-4098-b9ce-963bd975e9f8}}, {{cite:7fde16ad-509e-402b-9f7a-cc9fab664b97}}, {{cite:d48cfaa8-402d-40c8-bd56-20af11b6b3b1}}. The population of S stars
implies a capture rate of roughly FORMULA  yrFORMULA  for stars
with masses exceeding 5 FORMULA  {{cite:3a152766-a5d5-4da5-b94e-4c761c955517}}. Using their
complete spectroscopic sample of B-type stars in the outer halo, {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}
estimate a production rate of FORMULA  yrFORMULA  for unbound HVSs
with masses of 2.5–4 FORMULA . For an ensemble of stars selected from a Salpeter
IMF, these rates agree with theoretical predictions and with each other to
within a factor of two.
Predictions rates for runaways from supernovae depend on the local star formation
rate, the mass range adopted for B-type stars, the fraction of stars in binaries,
and the fraction of binaries with mass ratios and orbital periods capable of ejecting
a star with a velocity exceeding 10–20 km sFORMULA  {{cite:d77bb2f4-5e3c-4f67-afa9-2251dab9bffb}}, {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}.
For a star formation rate of 0.5 FORMULA  {{cite:075fe02c-dbb5-4487-9f33-7cf556df9223}} and for the observed
properties of binaries composed of B-type stars with masses of
2.5–4 FORMULA  {{cite:2c097366-16d8-4231-aac5-bc227c3017cc}}, supernovae produce runaways with minimum ejection
velocities of 10 km sFORMULA  at a rate of roughly FORMULA  yrFORMULA 
{{cite:d77bb2f4-5e3c-4f67-afa9-2251dab9bffb}}, {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}.
Predicting ejection rates for the dynamical runaway mechanism is more challenging.
From numerical simulations of dense clusters, {{cite:86c2d5d7-d51d-45dd-af63-e146037528d7}} estimate an ejection
rate for hyper-runaway B-type stars with FORMULA  450 km sFORMULA  of
FORMULA  yrFORMULA . For a power-law probability of the ejection velocity
(eq. [REF ]), the total ejection rate for B-type runaway stars with
FORMULA  10 km sFORMULA , is roughly FORMULA  yrFORMULA . This rate
suggests that dynamically generated runaways are somewhat more common
than supernova-induced runaways.
Empirical rates for runaways generally agree with these estimates. To derive these rates,
we estimate the formation rate of 2.5–3.5 FORMULA  stars from the observed star formation
rates and a Salpeter initial mass function. For the {{cite:075fe02c-dbb5-4487-9f33-7cf556df9223}} star formation rate
of 0.5 FORMULA , one star with a mass of 2.5–3.5 FORMULA  is born every 300–350 years.
To infer the fraction of runaway stars in this group, we rely on the observed
frequencies of less than 1% for A-type stars {{cite:4d1a6bc4-5419-4de2-a5a7-ab1eed265e32}}, {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}, 5% for
B-type stars {{cite:a4502327-47ba-4549-8433-5fc7686848f7}}, and more than 20% for O-type stars {{cite:35ba3882-0ab6-4388-9b7c-69c7e21f2bd6}}.
Adopting a 1–2% runaway frequency among 2.5–3.5 FORMULA  stars yields a production
rate of FORMULA  yrFORMULA . This rate is nearly identical to our purely
theoretical rate estimate.
Altogether, these estimates suggest our matching algorithm selects stars from
ensembles with similar formation rates. If we assume that bound HVSs have
a comparable frequency to unbound HVSs in the {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}} sample, the
combined HVS production rate of FORMULA  yrFORMULA  is identical
to the production rate of supernova-induced runaways. For the dynamically
generated runaways, we correct the complete ensemble for the fraction of
runaways with FORMULA  50 km sFORMULA . This correction yields an expected
rate of FORMULA  yrFORMULA , very close to the rates for HVSs
and supernova-induced runaways.
Although these estimates yield roughly similar production rates for HVSs
and both types of runaways, we expect unbound runaways to be much less
frequent than unbound HVSs. More than 25% of HVSs ejected from the GC to
distances FORMULA  10 kpc are unbound (§5). In contrast, FORMULA  1% of runaways
have ejection velocities larger than the local escape velocity. Thus,
unbound HVSs should greatly outnumber unbound runaways in the halo.
Overall, observations confirm the expectation that the number of unbound
runaways is smaller then the number of unbound HVSs
{{cite:d77bb2f4-5e3c-4f67-afa9-2251dab9bffb}}, {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}, {{cite:86c2d5d7-d51d-45dd-af63-e146037528d7}}. For every unbound
runaway, theory predicts 10–30 HVSs. Among known unbound stars, the vast
majority are HVSs {{cite:d77bb2f4-5e3c-4f67-afa9-2251dab9bffb}}.

Summary
Observations of HVS candidates and known runaways yield good tests of the
numerical simulations. The comparisons in the preceding subsections lead
to several clear conclusions.

Runaway models provide an excellent match to observations of known
runaway stars with modest radial velocities,
FORMULA  250 km sFORMULA  {{cite:c0fc5352-e9ce-44cc-adcf-e60cbc2085de}}.

The HVS models match observations of HVS candidates from {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}.

HVS and runaway star models fail to match observations of HVS candidates
from SEGUE {{cite:41e37042-4770-45ef-8052-beeba6dd5325}}. If the proper motions are correct, some other
model for ejected stars is required to match the observations.

Among a few miscellaneous high velocity stars, at least three are
runaways {{cite:b422dfca-b432-400a-8eb6-7ded2846ac95}}, {{cite:07c61e3a-c5b7-466e-b5e4-676f52787c8d}}, {{cite:98fd8023-0fee-4327-b4fe-e59eba772e87}}. Two others are more likely
HVSs {{cite:edaad942-4547-4cc1-a40d-a37fc99a72d9}}, {{cite:41684234-05c4-4999-8e7b-abf86bd360cd}}, {{cite:a83467b7-faa9-470a-95eb-82d2aeb44ff3}}.

Cleanly isolating unbound ejected stars from indigenous halo stars
requires radial velocities. If the halo contains a large population of
runaways ejected from the disk, these stars can be identified as high
proper motion outliers or by their rotational motion about the GC.

Observed and theoretical formation rates for HVSs and runaways suggest
that most unbound stars in the halo are HVSs.


DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
We have explored analytic treatments and have developed numerical calculations of
HVSs and runaway stars moving through the Galaxy. The simulations use a realistic
Galactic potential which matches observations in the GC, the bulge, the disk, and
the halo. Algorithms for the velocities of ejected stars are based on detailed
analytic and numerical calculations of
(i) binaries interacting with the black hole in the GC,
(ii) binaries where one component undergoes a supernova explosion, and
(iii) single and multiple stars interacting in a massive star cluster.
Realistic main sequence lifetimes allow snapshots of the positions and space motions
for ejected stars as a function of time.
The following theoretical results serve as a guide for interpreting data from
large-scale surveys with GAIA and ground-based telescopes.

Ejected stars have a broad range in
radial velocity (FORMULA  0–1000 km sFORMULA ) and
proper motion (FORMULA  0.01–100 milliarcsec yrFORMULA ).

At all distances, HVSs have larger space velocities than runaways.
For FORMULA  50–150 kpc, unbound HVSs dominate the population. Nearby
(FORMULA  10 kpc), unbound stars are rare; bound HVSs and runaways
are common.

For nearby stars with FORMULA  10 kpc, proper motions cannot
isolate high velocity ejected stars from horizontal branch stars in the halo.

At larger distances, radial velocities excel at distinguishing
ejected stars from indigenous halo stars.

For runaway stars ejected into the halo at FORMULA  20–50 kpc,
a double-peaked proper motion distribution results from orbital motion
around the GC. This distribution cleanly separates runaways from either
HVSs or halo stars on radial orbits.

Concentrations of high proper motion stars near the GC are a
unique signature of HVSs ejected from the GC or runaways ejected from
the inner galaxy.

These general conclusions are fairly independent of the modeling approach. The main
trends for bound and unbound stars depend on the point of origin (GC for HVSs or disk
for runaways) and the total mass of the Galaxy within roughly 10 kpc
{{cite:d58e45ac-eaee-4855-b395-c1531072c52d}}. Thus, modest changes to the mass of the Galaxy, the
mass in the bulge, disk, or halo, or to the velocity distributions of ejected stars
cannot modify our main conclusions. Adopting a triaxial potential for the bulge
or a more realistic disk-like potential for the GC can modify the median velocities,
the velocity dispersions, and the relative densities of HVSs with Galactic latitude
and longitude {{cite:24c8abb2-fbcf-4a94-8708-243d4453e63f}}, {{cite:e0aff0bf-14f1-4a54-b2a1-c549aa0eef48}}, {{cite:9cba7376-b7d3-48b6-8e9a-bf472365e5a5}}, {{cite:8ca2e605-2204-4676-bb65-3842847a5449}}, {{cite:6ab00def-ba3c-4758-adfc-6ed523f90925}}.
However, tests with realistic anisotropic potentials show that the general trends
do not depend on the form of the Galactic potential. Similarly, modest changes in
the adopted velocity distributions of ejected stars yield modest differences in
the shape of the predicted distributions of FORMULA  and FORMULA  with distance without
changing the nature of systematic variations with distance and Galactic coordinates.
Comparisons between these predictions and existing observations of ejected stars
are encouraging. Several large surveys of HVSs and runaways demonstrate several
unambiguous conclusions.

Simulations of supernova-induced and dynamically generated runaways
match observations of known runaway stars with modest radial velocities,
FORMULA  250 km sFORMULA  {{cite:c0fc5352-e9ce-44cc-adcf-e60cbc2085de}}. HVS models fail to match these data.

HVS models explain observations of HVS candidates from {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}.
Runaway star models cannot explain the data.

HVS and runaway star models fail to account for observations of HVS candidates
from SEGUE {{cite:41e37042-4770-45ef-8052-beeba6dd5325}}. If the proper motions of the SEGUE candidates are
correct, another model for ejected stars is required to match the observations.

Among a few miscellaneous high velocity stars, at least three are
runaways {{cite:b422dfca-b432-400a-8eb6-7ded2846ac95}}, {{cite:07c61e3a-c5b7-466e-b5e4-676f52787c8d}}, {{cite:98fd8023-0fee-4327-b4fe-e59eba772e87}}. Two others are more likely
HVSs {{cite:41684234-05c4-4999-8e7b-abf86bd360cd}}, {{cite:a83467b7-faa9-470a-95eb-82d2aeb44ff3}}.

Observed and theoretical formation rates for HVSs and runaways suggest
that most unbound stars in the halo are HVSs.

GAIA data will provide clear tests of the theoretical predictions and observational
comparisons outlined above. For solar-type stars with FORMULA  20, GAIA data will
yield robust samples of high velocity stars with FORMULA  0.5 milliarcsec yrFORMULA  and
FORMULA  10 kpc. Within this group, quantifying the (probably very low) fraction
of unbound stars can place useful limits on the velocity distributions of ejected stars.
More likely, identifying outliers in the distributions of proper motion and radial
velocity will yield a population of bound HVSs and runaways. Aside from the properties
of ejected stars, comparisons with theoretical models can yield information on the
potential of the bulge and inner disk.
Accurate GAIA proper motions (FORMULA  0.16 milliarcsec yrFORMULA ) for stars with
FORMULA  20 {{cite:7ad76de8-041f-4a2b-a418-b0b81a6d5fbd}}, {{cite:afdfc8f7-4f8e-498d-b643-f4fb5a54e615}}, high quality radial velocities from
large ground-based telescopes {{cite:f0a1d1a3-0ad5-4e8c-af09-665bf710a442}}, and good spectroscopic
parallaxes will probe the properties of unbound B-type stars
out to FORMULA  100 kpc. These data will yield improved constraints on
(i) the production rates for HVSs and runaways and
(ii) the relative populations of bound and unbound stars.
Although GAIA can identify stars with masses of roughly 10 FORMULA  to much larger
distances, the shorter main sequence lifetimes of these stars preclude large
populations beyond 20–30 kpc {{cite:ac11fc52-b852-42bb-99c9-2a06cc232b3e}}, {{cite:cecb8e47-6dd9-49a9-92d3-e0d862747e5d}}. If
ejections of very massive HVSs or runaways are more frequent than those of
3 FORMULA  stars, GAIA could discover a few massive, very high velocity ejected
stars beyond 100 kpc.
As dynamical models for ejected stars improve, GAIA observations of the complete
sample of 1–10 FORMULA  HVSs and runaways will enable new measurements of
anisotropies in the shape of the Galactic potential {{cite:24c8abb2-fbcf-4a94-8708-243d4453e63f}}, {{cite:e0aff0bf-14f1-4a54-b2a1-c549aa0eef48}}.
HVSs and runaways near the GC constrain the shape of the bulge. More distant
stars probe the shape of the halo. Together, HVSs and runaways in the bulge
and halo may yield new insights into the distribution of dark matter throughout
the Galaxy.
