Sharpening randomization-based causal inference for FORMULA  factorial designs with binary outcomesForthcoming in Statistical Methods in Medical Research.[2018/12/10 04:50:52
In medical research, a scenario often entertained is randomized controlled FORMULA  factorial design with a binary outcome. By utilizing the concept of potential outcomes, {{cite:ed868d4d-1fa3-4f7e-ae57-ddd1eb21afe5}} proposed a randomization-based causal inference framework, allowing flexible and simultaneous estimations and inferences of the factorial effects. However, a fundamental challenge that {{cite:ed868d4d-1fa3-4f7e-ae57-ddd1eb21afe5}}'s proposed methodology faces is that the sampling variance of the randomization-based factorial effect estimator is unidentifiable, rendering the corresponding classic “Neymanian” variance estimator suffering from over-estimation. To address this issue, for randomized controlled FORMULA  factorial designs with binary outcomes, we derive the sharp lower bound of the sampling variance of the factorial effect estimator, which leads to a new variance estimator that sharpens the finite-population Neymanian causal inference. We demonstrate the advantages of the new variance estimator through a series of simulation studies, and apply our newly proposed methodology to two real-life datasets from randomized clinical trials, where we gain new insights.
Keywords: factorial effect; finite-population analysis; inclusion-exclusion principle; partial identification; potential outcome.

Introduction
Since originally introduced to conduct and analyze agricultural experiments {{cite:e0cc7fe6-7748-4ad6-a6ca-c35cbbc18e9b}}, {{cite:d214d1c0-aff2-462c-9371-6482c4cc82dc}}, factorial designs have been widely applied in social, behavioral and biomedical sciences, because of their capabilities to evaluate multiple treatment factors simultaneously. In particular, over the past half-century, randomized controlled FORMULA  factorial designs have become more well-adopted in medical research, in which the research interest often lies in assessing the (main and interactive) causal effects of two distinct binary treatment factors on a binary outcome. Among the lengthy list of medical studies that are powered by FORMULA  factorial designs {{cite:5de109fe-9d05-42f2-9fea-f69a3ca5cf51}}, {{cite:be6358b6-9ad7-46b3-a3de-98bedb4550bb}}, {{cite:24852ea7-5d9e-42da-8c09-016c14ebe469}}, {{cite:feb91989-c1fb-418f-b9c5-15b4bdbd5fb6}}, {{cite:10b296f8-5c16-404c-b021-f1023fc6ad2d}}, {{cite:3c4a6500-e50c-4d18-85a4-01814801a9e7}}, {{cite:31b57786-fc12-4c01-ba23-1f00537fa7a6}}, {{cite:04cc516c-6f99-4bbf-a47a-2b3c50431c42}}, {{cite:2fb07597-a553-4e28-b302-5253a7715792}}, {{cite:95560c64-2337-4b21-a6cc-0e90a61f3668}}, one of the most impactful examples is the landmark Physicians' Health Study {{cite:67155906-9289-4b3f-8a34-0f1f6868f96b}}, in which over ten thousand patients were randomly assign to four experimental arms – 1. placebo aspirin and placebo FORMULA carotene; 2. placebo aspirin and active FORMULA carotene; 3. active aspirin and placebo FORMULA carotene; 4. active aspirin and active FORMULA carotene. This study contained multiple important end-points that were binary, e.g., cardiovascular mortality.
For traditional treatment-control studies (i.e., FORMULA  factorial designs), a well-developed and popular methodology to conduct causal inference is the potential outcomes framework {{cite:55c0bc3f-5934-4cc6-82b2-169a22aaead1}}, {{cite:f6ae7175-83a8-482a-ac47-636fdd588a99}}, where we define causal effects as comparisons (difference, ratio, et al.) between the treated and control potential outcomes, which are assumed to be fixed for each experimental unit. Consequently, estimation and inference of causal effects solely depend on treatment assignment randomization, which is often regarded as the gold standard for causal inference {{cite:5db63659-d917-40b9-9b11-99fcfc299d9a}}. As a randomization-based methodology, the potential outcomes framework possesses several advantages against other existing approaches, many of which are model-based. For example, it is fully non-parametric and therefore more robust to model mis-specification, and better suited for finite population analyses, which under certain circumstances are more appropriate as pointed by several researchers {{cite:fd4d0a4a-51f7-435f-bbe3-ddd2bc67c0e4}}.
Realizing the salient feature of the potential outcomes framework, {{cite:ed868d4d-1fa3-4f7e-ae57-ddd1eb21afe5}} formally extended it to FORMULA  factorial designs, by defining the factorial effects as linear contrasts of potential outcomes under different treatment combinations, and proposing the corresponding estimation and inferential procedures. {{cite:ed868d4d-1fa3-4f7e-ae57-ddd1eb21afe5}} argued that by utilizing the concept of potential outcomes, the proposed randomization-based framework “results in better understanding
of” factorial effects, and “allows greater flexibility in statistical inference.” However it is worth mentioning that, while “inherited” many desired properties of the potential outcomes framework, inevitably it also inherited a fundamental issue – the sampling variance of the randomization-based estimator for the factorial effects is unidentifiable, and therefore the corresponding classic “Neymanian” variance estimator suffers from the issue of over-estimation in general (see Section 6.5 of {{cite:0e5b2dbd-6ac8-4869-9434-0a7815f83752}} for a detailed discussion) – in fact, as pointed by {{cite:06433cd5-1258-4ae4-8647-bb3f4205ff85}}, it is generally impossible to unbiasedly estimate the sampling variance, because we simply cannot directly infer the association between the potential outcomes. For treatment-control studies, this problem has been extensively investigated and somewhat well-resolved, for binary {{cite:42d0ab4d-11c9-419d-adc0-60d070753496}}, {{cite:a3aa2817-9501-462d-9904-da9743f352fe}} and more general outcomes {{cite:06433cd5-1258-4ae4-8647-bb3f4205ff85}}. However, to our best knowledge, similar discussions appear to be absent in the existing literature for FORMULA  factorial designs, which are of both theoretical and practical interests. Motivated by several real-life examples in medical research, in this paper we take a first step towards filling this important gap, by sharpening randomized-based causal inference for FORMULA  factorial designs with binary outcomes. To be more specific, we derive the sharp (formally defined later) lower bound of the sampling variance of the factorial effect estimator, and propose the corresponding “improved” Neymanian variance estimator.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section  we briefly review the randomization-based causal inference framework for FORMULA  factorial designs, focusing on binary outcomes. Section  presents the bias (i.e., magnitude of over-estimation) of the classic Neymanian variance estimator, derives the sharp lower bound of the bias, proposes the corresponding improved Neymanian variance estimator, and illustrate our results through several numerical and visual examples. Sections  conducts a series of simulation studies to highlight the performance of the improved variance estimator. Section  applied our newly proposed methodology to two real-life medical studies, where new insights are gained. Section  discusses future directions and concludes. We relegate the technical details to Appendices  and .

Randomization-based causal inference for FORMULA  factorial designs with binary outcomes
FORMULA  factorial designs
To review Neymanian causal inference for FORMULA  factorial designs, we adapt materials by {{cite:ed868d4d-1fa3-4f7e-ae57-ddd1eb21afe5}} and {{cite:1402fcbb-6541-4d75-9a77-f8e3a4146306}}, and tailor them to the specific case with binary outcomes. In FORMULA  factorial designs, there are two treatment factors (each with two-levels coded as -1 and 1) and 4 distinct treatment combinations FORMULA  FORMULA  To define them, we rely on the model matrix {{cite:033e5299-e65b-4214-b4f8-23c0e49c4eab}}
FORMULA 
The treatment combinations are FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  and FORMULA  and later we will use FORMULA  FORMULA  and FORMULA  to define the factorial effects.

Randomization-based inference
By utilizing potential outcomes, {{cite:ed868d4d-1fa3-4f7e-ae57-ddd1eb21afe5}} proposed a framework for randomization-based causal inference for FORMULA  factorial designs. For our purpose, we consider a FORMULA  factorial design with FORMULA  experimental units. Under the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption {{cite:b546ae8e-6718-4e6e-8303-84c86cdb14c1}}, for FORMULA  we define FORMULA  as the potential outcome of unit FORMULA  under treatment combination FORMULA  and let
FORMULA 
In this paper we only consider binary outcomes, i.e., FORMULA  for all FORMULA  and  FORMULA
To save space, we introduce two sets of notations. First, we let
FORMULA 
Consequently, instead of specifying the potential outcomes
FORMULA 
entry by entry, we can equivalently characterize them using the “joint distribution” vector
FORMULA 
where the indices are ordered binary representations of zero to fifteen. Second, for all non-empty sets
FORMULA 
we let
FORMULA 
Therefore, for FORMULA  the average potential outcome for FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
and let
FORMULA 
Define the FORMULA th (individual and population) factorial effects as
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  which correspond to the main effects of the first and second treatment factors, and their interaction effect, respectively.
Having defined the treatment combinations, potential outcomes and factorial effects, next we discuss the treatment assignment and observed data. Suppose for FORMULA  we randomly assign FORMULA  (a pre-specified constant) units to treatment combination FORMULA  Let
FORMULA 
be the treatment assignments, and
FORMULA 
be the observed outcome for unit FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
Therefore, the average observed potential outcome for FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
for all
FORMULA 
Denote
FORMULA 
and the randomization-based estimators for
FORMULA 
is
FORMULA 
which are unbiased with respect to the randomization distribution.
Motivated by several relevant discussions in the existing literature {{cite:3fd70522-dd4b-4ddb-9a26-93a255091c4e}}, {{cite:3d17fc57-72a0-4996-8a37-7a6c4ad29421}}, {{cite:ed868d4d-1fa3-4f7e-ae57-ddd1eb21afe5}}, {{cite:a3aa2817-9501-462d-9904-da9743f352fe}}, {{cite:97e2f14b-de69-4ebc-b1e3-671262256eee}}, {{cite:1402fcbb-6541-4d75-9a77-f8e3a4146306}}, {{cite:136647c2-949f-4197-a608-dec021fc1a07}} proved the consistency and asymptotic Normality of the randomization-based estimator in (REF ), and derived its sampling variance as
FORMULA 
where for  FORMULA
FORMULA 
is the variance of potential outcomes for FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
is the variance of the FORMULA th (individual) factorial effects in (REF ).

Improving the Neymanian variance estimator
Background
Given the sampling variance in (REF ), we estimate it by substituting FORMULA  with its unbiased estimate
FORMULA 
and substituting
FORMULA 
with its lower bound 0 (due to the fact that it is not identifiable, because none of the individual factorial effects FORMULA 's are observable). Consequently, we obtain the “classic Neymanian” variance estimator is
FORMULA 
This estimator over-estimates the true sampling variance on average by
FORMULA 
unless strict additivity {{cite:ed868d4d-1fa3-4f7e-ae57-ddd1eb21afe5}} holds, i.e.,
FORMULA 
which is unlikely to happen in real-life scenarios, especially for binary outcomes {{cite:4544a74f-4212-4bb7-83f2-37a1f946f04b}}, {{cite:5b38c994-6d7c-40f9-b2a4-2a845e5ada44}}. We summarize and illustrate the above results by the following example.
Example 1 Consider a hypothetical FORMULA  factorial design with FORMULA  units, whose potential outcomes, factorial effects and summary statistics are shown in Table REF , from which we draw several conclusions – first, the population-level factorial effects in (REF ) are -0.1563, -0.0313 and -0.0313, respectively; second, the sampling variances of the randomization-based estimators in (REF ) are 0.0425, 0.0493 and 0.0493, respectively; third, if we employ the classic Neymanian variance estimator in (REF ), on average we will over-estimate the sampling variances by 52.5%, 31.6% and 31.6%, respectively.
TABLE 


Sharp lower bound of the sampling variance
As demonstrated in previous sections, the key to improve the classic Neymanian variance estimator (REF ) is obtaining a non-zero and identifiable lower bound of
FORMULA 
To achieve this goal, we adopt the partial identification philosophy, commonly used in the existing literature to bound either the randomization-based sampling variances of causal parameters {{cite:06433cd5-1258-4ae4-8647-bb3f4205ff85}}, or the causal parameters themselves {{cite:3e33d05a-63c1-49cf-b228-54e4e83dd05b}}, {{cite:c8e9d12b-96c1-4cbb-96de-106b01095100}}, {{cite:3a205385-2dda-4d9a-84c9-077fda7dfd03}}.
We first present two lemmas, which play central roles in the proof of our main theorem.
Lemma 1 
Let
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  Then
FORMULA 


Lemma 2 
For all FORMULA  define
FORMULA 
Then
FORMULA 
and the equality in (REF ) holds if and only if
FORMULA 
or
FORMULA 


We provide the proofs of Lemmas REF  and REF  in Appendix . With the help of the lemmas, we present an identifiable sharp lower bound of
 FORMULA
Theorem 1 
The sharp lower bound for
FORMULA 
is
FORMULA 
The equality in (REF ) holds if and only if (REF ) or (REF ) holds.

By employing the inclusion-exclusion principle and Bonferroni's inequality, we provide the proof of Theorem REF  in Appendix . The lower bound in Theorem REF  is sharp in the sense that it is compatible with the marginal counts of the potential outcomes
FORMULA 
(and consequently FORMULA ). To be more specific, for fixed values of
FORMULA 
there exists a hypothetical set of potential outcomes
FORMULA 
such that
FORMULA 
Theorem REF  effectively generalizes the discussions regarding binary outcomes by {{cite:42d0ab4d-11c9-419d-adc0-60d070753496}} and {{cite:a3aa2817-9501-462d-9904-da9743f352fe}}, from treatment-control studies to FORMULA  factorial designs. In particular, the conditions in (REF ) and (REF ) echo the parallel results by {{cite:a3aa2817-9501-462d-9904-da9743f352fe}}, and therefore we name them the “generalized” monotonicity conditions on the potential outcomes. However, intuitive and straightforward as it seems, proving Theorem REF  turns out to be a non-trivial task.

The “improved” Neymanian variance estimator
The sharp lower bound in (REF ) leads to the “improved” Neymanian variance estimator
FORMULA 
which is guaranteed to be smaller than the classic Neymanian variance estimator in (REF ) for any observed data, because the correction term on the right hand side of (REF ) is always non-negative. For example, for balanced designs (i.e., FORMULA ) with large sample sizes, the relative estimated variance reduction is
FORMULA 
We illustrate the above results by the following numerical example.
Example 2 Consider a balanced FORMULA  factorial design with FORMULA  experimental units, so that
FORMULA 
For the purpose of visualizing the estimated variance reduction under various settings, we repeatedly draw
FORMULA 
for 5000 times, and plot the corresponding FORMULA 's in Figure REF . We can draw several conclusions from the results. First, for 13% of the times FORMULA  is smaller than 1%, corresponding to cases where FORMULA  0 or FORMULA  Second, for 13% of the times FORMULA  is larger than 10%. Third, the largest FORMULA  is approximately 20.5%, corresponding to the case where

FORMULA 
guarantees that the improved Neymanian variance estimator still over-estimates the sampling variance on average, unless one of the generalized monotonicity conditions in (REF )–(REF ) holds. Nevertheless, it does improve the classic Neymanian variance estimator in (REF ), and more importantly, this improvement is the “best we can do” without additional information. In the next section, we conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the finite-sample properties of, and to compare the performances of, the classic and improved Neymanian variance estimators.

Simulation studies
To save space, we focus on the first factorial effect
FORMULA 
and its randomization-based statistical inference. To mimic the empirical examples that we will re-analyze in the next section, we choose the sample size FORMULA  Moreover, to (at least to some extent) explore the complex dependence structure of the potential outcomes, we adopt the latent multivariate Normal model for the underlying data generation mechanism is. To be more specific, let
FORMULA 
and assume that for each  FORMULA
FORMULA 
We consider the following six cases:
FORMULA 
We choose the above values for FORMULA  so that the corresponding factorial effects FORMULA  (the approximaition is due to finite-sample fluctuation) for Cases 1–2. Similarly, FORMULA  for Cases 3 and 4, and FORMULA  for Cases 5 and 6. Therefore, we can examine the scenarios where the sharp lower bound
FORMULA 
in (REF ) are either small or large in magnitude. Moreover, we partially adopt the simulation settings by {{cite:ed868d4d-1fa3-4f7e-ae57-ddd1eb21afe5}} and let
FORMULA 
which corresponds to negatively correlated, independent and positively correlated potential outcomes, respectively. The aforementioned data generation mechanism resulted eighteen “joint distributions” of the potential outcomes
FORMULA 
which we report in the third column of Table . For each simulation case (i.e., row of Table ), we adopt the following three-step procedure:

Use (REF ) and (REF ) to calculate
FORMULA 
the sampling variance of its randomization-based estimator and its lower bound, respectively, and report them in the fourth to sixth columns of Table ;

Independently draw 10000 treatment assignments from a balanced FORMULA  factorial design with  FORMULA

For each observed data-set, use (REF ), (REF ) and (REF ) to calculate the point estimate of FORMULA  the classic and improved Neymanian variance estimates respectively, based on which we construct two 95% confidence intervals.

To examine the performances of the classic and improved Neymanian variance estimators in (REF ) and (REF ), in the last six columns of Table , we report the relative (i.e., percentage wise) over-estimations of the true sampling variance, the average lengths and the coverage rates of their corresponding confidence intervals of the two estimators, respectively.
We can draw several conclusions from the results. First, because of the non-negative correction term
FORMULA 
for all cases the improved Neymanian variance estimator (REF ) reduces the over-estimation of the sampling variance, shortens the confidence intervals and achieves better coverage rates without under-covering. For example, in Case 4 with FORMULA  the improved Neymanian variance estimator reduces the coverage rate from 0.974 to 0.956, achieving near nominal level. Second, by comparing Case 1 with Case 2 (or 3 with 4, 5 with 6), we can see that for a fixed FORMULA  although the absolute magnitude of the correction term is the same, the performance (i.e., reduction of percentage of over-estimation, average length and coverage rate) of the improved Neymanian variance estimator might differ significantly, depending on the “marginal distributions” of the potential outcomes (characterized by the mean parameter FORMULA ). Third, for a fixed marginal distribution, the performance of the improved Neymanian variance estimator might also differ significantly, depending on the dependence structure of the potential outcomes (characterized by the association parameter FORMULA ). Fourth, in certain scenarios, while the improved Neymanian variance estimator only slightly shortens the confidence interval, it leads to a non-ignorable improvement on coverage rates. For example, in Case 5 with FORMULA  a less than 5% shorter confidence interval reduces the coverage rate from 0.976 to 0.966.
To take into account alternative data generation mechanisms and thus provide a more comprehensive pircute, in Appendix  we conduct an additional series of simulation studies, where we focus on several discrete outcome distributions. The results largely agree with the above conclusions.

To examine the performances of the classic and improved Neymanian variance estimators in (REF ) and (REF ), the last six columns contain their percentages of over-estimation of the true sampling variance, and the average lengths and coverage rates of their corresponding confidence intervals.

Empirical examples
A study on smoking habits
In 2004, the University of Kansas Medical Center conducted a randomized controlled FORMULA  factorial design to study the smoking habits of African American light smokers, i.e., those “who smoke 10 or fewer cigarettes per day for at least six months prior to the study” {{cite:87766f2a-e7f5-4ea5-b096-056e2127df19}}. The study focused on two treatment factors – nicotine gum consumption (2gm/day vs. placebo), and counseling (health education vs. motivational interviewing). Among FORMULA  participants, FORMULA  were randomly assigned to FORMULA  (placebo and motivational interviewing), FORMULA  to FORMULA  (placebo and health education), FORMULA  to FORMULA  (nicotine gum and motivational interviewing), and FORMULA  to FORMULA  (nicotine gum and health education). The primary outcome of interest was abstinence from smoking 26 weeks after enrollment, determined by whether salivary cotinine level was less than 20 ng/ml. {{cite:87766f2a-e7f5-4ea5-b096-056e2127df19}} reported that
 FORMULA
We re-analyze this data set in order to illustrate our proposed methodology. To save space we only focus on FORMULA  the main effect of counseling. The observed data suggests that its point estimate FORMULA  the 95% confidence intervals based on the classic and improved Neymanian variance estimators are (-0.129, -0.035) and (-0.127, -0.037), respectively. While the results largely corroborate {{cite:87766f2a-e7f5-4ea5-b096-056e2127df19}}'s analysis and conclusion, the improved variance estimator does provide a narrower confidence interval – the variance estimate by the improved Neymanian variance estimator is 92.1% of that by the classic Neymanian variance estimator.

A study on saphenous-vein coronary-artery bypass grafts
The Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft trial is a randomized controlled FORMULA  factorial design conducted between March 1989 and August 1991, on patients who were “21 to 74 years of age, had low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of no more than 200 mg/deciliter, and
had had at least two saphenous-vein coronary bypass grafts placed 1 to 11 years before the start of the study” {{cite:137c388b-a4de-4f27-a1d2-542ca10955e1}}. The study concerned two treatment factors – LDL cholesterol level lowering (aggressive, goal is 60–85 mg/deciliter vs. moderate), and low-dose anticoagulation (1mg warfarin vs. placebo). Among FORMULA  participants, FORMULA  were randomly assigned to FORMULA  (moderate LDL lowering and placebo), FORMULA  to FORMULA  (moderate LDL lowering and warfarin), FORMULA  to FORMULA  (aggressive LDL lowering and placebo), and FORMULA  to FORMULA  (aggressive LDL lowering and warfarin). For the purpose of illustration, we define the outcome of interest as the composite end point (defined as death from cardiovascular or unknown causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or coronary-artery bypass grafting) four years after enrollment. {{cite:137c388b-a4de-4f27-a1d2-542ca10955e1}} (in Table 5 and Figure 2, pp. 160) reported that

which implies that
 FORMULA
We re-analyze the interactive effect FORMULA  The observed data suggests that FORMULA  and the 95% confidence intervals based on the classic and improved Neymanian variance estimators are (0.130, 0.202) and (0.133, 0.200), respectively. Again, the improved Neymanian variance estimator provides a narrower confidence interval, because its variance estimate is only 87.7% of that by the classic Neymanian variance estimator. Moreover, the results suggest a statistically significant interactive effect between LDL cholesterol lowering and low-dose anticoagulation treatments, which appeared to be absent in {{cite:137c388b-a4de-4f27-a1d2-542ca10955e1}}'s original paper.

Concluding remarks
Motivated by several empirical examples in medical research, in this paper we studied {{cite:ed868d4d-1fa3-4f7e-ae57-ddd1eb21afe5}}'s randomization-based causal inference framework, under which factorial effects are defined as linear contrasts of potential outcomes under different treatment combinations, and the corresponding difference-in-means estimator's only source of randomness is the treatment assignment itself. However, as pointed out by {{cite:06433cd5-1258-4ae4-8647-bb3f4205ff85}}, a long standing challenge faced by such finite-population frameworks is estimating the true sampling variance of the randomization-based estimator. In this paper, we solve this problem and therefore sharpen randomization-based causal inference for FORMULA  factorial designs with binary outcomes, which is not only of theoretical interest, but also arguably the most common and important setting for medical research among all factorial designs. To be more specific, we propose a new variance estimator improving the classic Neymanian variance estimator by {{cite:ed868d4d-1fa3-4f7e-ae57-ddd1eb21afe5}}. The key idea behind our proposed methodology is obtaining the sharp lower bound of the variance of unit-level factorial effects, and using a plug-in estimator for the lower bound. Through several numerical, simulated and empirical examples, we demonstrated the advantages of our new variance estimator.
There are multiple future directions based on our current work. First, although more of theoretical interests, it is possible to extend our methodology to general FORMULA  factorial designs, or even more complex designs such as FORMULA  or fractional factorial designs. Second, we can generalize our existing results for binary outcomes to other scenarios (continuous, time to event, et al.). Third, although this paper focuses on the “Neymanian” type analyses, the Bayesian counterpart of causal inference for FORMULA  factorial designs might be desirable. However, it is worth mentioning that, instead of adopting model-based approaches {{cite:e60fe74e-3493-410c-aa6e-66341d0bd6a4}}, we seek to extend {{cite:b6507a18-01a2-4c20-be07-48a65e8539c7}}'s and {{cite:a3aa2817-9501-462d-9904-da9743f352fe}}'s finite-population Bayesian causal inference framework to factorial designs, which requires a full Bayesian model on the joint distribution of the potential outcomes under all treatment combinations. However, this direction faces several challenges. For example, characterizing the dependence structure in multivariate binary distributions can be extremely complex, as pointed out by {{cite:2a157049-afb2-4e81-a57e-a95ed40a560c}} and {{cite:b91e1db3-325a-47d7-9bbc-49ad9fe0acad}}. Fourth, it would be interesting to explore the potential use of our proposed variance estimator for constructions of non-parametric tests in factorial designs {{cite:fced20d7-76bb-4b3f-aa8f-3d18f43493ed}}, {{cite:6c03d809-5261-4ed6-8693-939d6d52c94b}}. Fifth, it is possible to further improve our variance estimator, by incorporating pre-treatment covariate information. All of the above are our ongoing or future research projects.

Proofs of lemmas, theorems and corollaries
[Proof of Lemma REF ]
The proof in large follows . By (REF )
FORMULA 

By combining the above and the fact that
FORMULA 
the proof is complete.
[Proof of Lemma REF ]
We only prove the case where FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
because other cases (FORMULA ) are analogous. We break down (REF ) to two parts:
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
and prove them one by one. It is worth emphasizing that, for the equality in (REF ) to hold, we only need the equality in either (REF ) or (REF ) to hold.
To prove (REF ), note that
FORMULA 
and therefore (REF ) is equivalent to
FORMULA 
We use the inclusion-exclusion principal to prove the above. First, it is obvious that
FORMULA 
and the equality holds if and only if the set
FORMULA 
or equivalently
FORMULA 
Second, note that
FORMULA 

The equality in (REF ) holds if and only if
FORMULA 
Third, by the same argument we have
FORMULA 
and the equality in (REF ) holds if and only if
FORMULA 
Fourth, by applying the similar logic, we have
FORMULA 

and the equality in (REF ) holds if and only if
FORMULA 
By combining (REF ), (REF ), (REF ) and (REF ), we have proved that (REF ) holds. Moreover, the equality in (REF ) holds if and only if (REF ), (REF ), (REF ) and (REF ) hold simultaneously, i.e., the four conditions in (REF ), (REF ), (REF ) and (REF ) are met simultaneously. We leave it to the readers to verify that this is indeed
equivalent to (REF ), i.e. for all  FORMULA
FORMULA 
The proof of (REF ) is symmetrical, because it is equivalent to
FORMULA 
In particular, the equality in (REF ) holds if and only if (REF ) holds (again we leave the verification to the readers). The proof is complete.
[Proof of Theorem REF ]
The proof directly follows from (REF ), and Lemma REF  and REF .

Additional simulation studies
We conduct an additional series of simulation studies to take into account data generation mechanisms different from those described in Section . In order to generate a “diverse” set of joint distributions of the potential outcomes
FORMULA 
while keeping the simulation cases closer to our empirical examples, we let
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
The main rationale behind the above data generation mechanism is that, in many medical studies the (potential) primary endpoint (e.g., mortality) is zero for most patients under any treatment combination. Indeed, our setting guarantees that on average 66.7% of the experimental units have FORMULA  for all  FORMULA
We use the aforementioned data generation mechanism to produce 50 simulation cases. For each simulation case, we follow the procedure described in Section , and (to make the article concise) report only the coverage results in Figure REF . The results largely agree with the conclusions made in Section , i.e., the improved Neymanian variance estimator in (REF ) always, and sometimes greatly, mitigates the over-estimation issue of the classic Neymaninan variance estimator.
