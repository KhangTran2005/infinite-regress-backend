We study the weak finite element method solving
convection-diffusion equations. A weak finite element scheme is
presented based on a spacial variational form. We established a
weak embedding inequality that is very useful in the weak finite
element analysis. The optimal order error estimates are derived in
the discrete FORMULA -norm, the FORMULA -norm and the FORMULA -norm,
respectively. In particular, the FORMULA -superconvergence of order
FORMULA  is given under certain condition. Finally, numerical
examples are provided to illustrate
our theoretical analysis.

Introduction
Recently, the weak
Galerkin finite element method attracts much attention in the
field of numerical partial differential equations
{{cite:5841b255-1870-4382-ae86-03f36476c1f2}}, {{cite:087d0522-0ead-4a39-9711-7b6f0ecd7597}}, {{cite:842e9a3a-373b-4c87-9562-87d5ade86f72}}, {{cite:14c53a73-6774-4bcd-a6e1-91f99ef6f167}}, {{cite:48fb5840-225d-4232-8651-f4bef6865037}}, {{cite:53bd4287-a54b-4550-8f7b-4172334f7210}}, {{cite:8e68eb45-1f06-4b2b-b7a3-456c85b154c9}}, {{cite:1d0d8e36-cb09-4397-a98b-92c263082b4f}}, {{cite:8c3a9d0d-c0bc-43bc-8565-f29377fd2399}}. This method is
presented originally by Wang and Ye for solving general elliptic problems
in multi-dimensional domain {{cite:5841b255-1870-4382-ae86-03f36476c1f2}}. Since then, some modified
weak Galerkin methods have also been studied, for example, see
{{cite:1b6efb03-12e2-49a0-bcaa-6045d9db6307}}, {{cite:1bb6f6a9-8c7f-41d2-80a9-8354b0d11ee2}}, {{cite:c72d12bb-ec08-494d-8b2f-abc6c4a898db}}, {{cite:dc81d6f1-2ccd-4cd3-80b2-08dca171c49d}}. In general, a weak finite element method can be
considered as an extension of the standard finite element method
where classical derivatives are replaced in the variational
equation by the weakly defined derivatives on discontinuous
functions. The main feature of this method is that it allows the
use of totally discontinuous finite element function and the trace
of finite element function on element edge may be independent with
its value in the interior of element. This feature make this
method possess all advantages of the usual discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) finite element method {{cite:9ffdbcd3-45f8-4e97-9411-c9323487776c}}, {{cite:4ccff9f7-ba71-42b6-bf42-a8e61cc39bd1}}, {{cite:7f447392-b89b-486f-b660-40adfea1b00f}}, and it has
higher flexibility than the DG method. The readers are referred to
articles {{cite:087d0522-0ead-4a39-9711-7b6f0ecd7597}}, {{cite:842e9a3a-373b-4c87-9562-87d5ade86f72}}, {{cite:4ccff9f7-ba71-42b6-bf42-a8e61cc39bd1}} for more detailed explanation of
this method and its relation with other finite element methods.
In this paper, we study the weak finite element method for
convection-diffusion equations:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , coefficient matrix FORMULA  and FORMULA  is a vector function.
We first introduce the weak gradient and discrete weak gradient
following the way in {{cite:5841b255-1870-4382-ae86-03f36476c1f2}}. Then, we consider how to
discretize problem (REF ) by using weak finite elements. In
order to make the weak finite element equation have a positive
property, we present a spacial weak form for problem (REF ).
This weak form is different from the conventional one and is very
suitable for the weak finite element discretization. We establish
a discrete embedding inequality on the weak finite element space
which provides a useful tool for the weak finite element analysis.
In analogy to the usual finite element research, we derive the
optimal order error estimates in the discrete FORMULA -norm, the
FORMULA -norm and the FORMULA -norm, respectively. In particular,
for the pure elliptic problems in divergence form
(FORMULA , FORMULA ), we obtain an FORMULA -order
superconvergence estimate for the gradient approximation of the
weak finite element solution, when the FORMULA -order finite
element polynomial pair (interior and edge of element) is used.
Both our theoretical analysis and numerical experiment show that
this weak finite element method is a high accuracy and efficiency
numerical method.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we establish the
weak finite element method for problem (REF ). In Section 3,
some approximation functions are given and the stability of the
weak finite element solution is analyzed. Section 4 is devoted to
the optimal error estimate and superconvergence estimate in
various norms. In Section 5, we discuss how to solve the weak
finite element discrete system of equations and then provide some
numerical examples to illustrate our theoretical analysis.
Throughout this paper, for a real FORMULA , we adopt the notations
FORMULA  to indicate the usual Sobolev spaces on domain
FORMULA  equipped with the norm FORMULA  and
semi-norm FORMULA , and if FORMULA , we set
FORMULA , FORMULA . When
FORMULA , we omit the index FORMULA . The notations FORMULA 
and FORMULA  denote the inner product and norm in the space
FORMULA , respectively. We will use letter FORMULA  to represent a
generic positive constant, independent of the mesh size FORMULA .

Problem and its weak finite element approximation
Consider the
convection-diffusion equations:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a polygonal or polyhedral
domain with boundary FORMULA , coefficient matrix
FORMULA  is uniformly positive definite in
FORMULA , i.e., there exists a positive constant FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
We assume that FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA . As usual, we further assume that
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be a regular triangulation of
domain FORMULA  so that FORMULA , where the mesh size FORMULA , FORMULA  is the
diameter of element FORMULA .
In order to define the weak finite element approximation to
problem (REF ), we first need to introduce the concepts of weak
derivative and discrete weak derivative, which are originally
presented in {{cite:5841b255-1870-4382-ae86-03f36476c1f2}}.
Let element FORMULA , denote the interior and boundary of FORMULA  by
FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively. A weak function on element
FORMULA  refers to a function FORMULA  with FORMULA . Note that for
a weak function FORMULA , FORMULA  may not be necessarily the
trace of FORMULA 
on FORMULA .
Definition 2.1.   The weak derivative FORMULA  of a weak
function FORMULA  with respect to variable FORMULA  is defined as a linear
functional in the dual space FORMULA  whose action on each
FORMULA  is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the outward unit
normal vector on FORMULA .
Obviously, as a bounded linear functional on FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is well defined. Moreover, for FORMULA ,
if we consider FORMULA  as a weak function with components
FORMULA , FORMULA , then by the Green formula,
we have for FORMULA  that
FORMULA 
which implies that FORMULA  is the
usual derivative of function FORMULA .
According to Definition 2.1, the weak gradient FORMULA  of a
weak function FORMULA  should be such that FORMULA 
satisfies
FORMULA 
Below we introduce the discrete weak gradient which is actually
used in our analysis.
For any non-negative integer FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the space
composed of all polynomials on set FORMULA  with degree no more than
FORMULA . Introduce the discrete weak function space on  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Definition 2.2.   For FORMULA , the discrete weak derivative
FORMULA  is defined as the unique solution
of equation:
FORMULA 
According to Definition 2.2, for weak function FORMULA ,
its discrete weak gradient
FORMULA  is the unique solution of equation:
FORMULA 
Remark 2.1.   We here first define the (discrete) weak
derivative, and then the (discrete) weak gradient follows
naturally. This method of defining (discrete) weak gradient is
slightly different from that in {{cite:5841b255-1870-4382-ae86-03f36476c1f2}}, in which the
(discrete) weak gradient is defined solely.
From (REF ) and (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
This shows that FORMULA  is a discrete approximation of
FORMULA  in FORMULA . In particular, if FORMULA , we
have from (REF ) and (REF ) that
FORMULA 
That is, FORMULA  is the FORMULA  projection of FORMULA  in
FORMULA  if FORMULA .
We have introduced the weak derivative (gradient) and discrete
weak derivative (gradient), but only the discrete weak gradient
given in (REF ) will be used throughout this paper. The others
also should be useful in the study of numerical partial
differential equations.
A important property of FORMULA  can be stated as follows,
see {{cite:5841b255-1870-4382-ae86-03f36476c1f2}}.
Lemma 2.1.   Let FORMULA  be a weak
function and FORMULA . Then, FORMULA  on FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA , that is, FORMULA  on FORMULA .
Now, we construct the weak finite element space. Denote by
FORMULA  the
union of all boundary faces or edges (FORMULA ) of elements in FORMULA 
that are not contained in FORMULA . Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be
two adjacent elements with the common face FORMULA , and FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the outward unit normal
vectors on FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively. For weak function
defined on FORMULA , set
FORMULA . We define
the jump of weak function FORMULA  on FORMULA  by
FORMULA 
Then, weak function FORMULA  is single value on FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA . The weak finite element space is now defined by
FORMULA 
In order to define the weak finite element approximation to
problem (REF ), we need to derive a spacial weak form for
problem (REF ). From the differential formula
FORMULA 
and the Green formula, we see that a weak form for problem
(REF ) is to find FORMULA  FORMULA 
such that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . Denote
the discrete FORMULA  inner product and norm by
FORMULA 
Motivated by weak form (REF ), we define the weak finite
element approximation of problem (REF ) by finding FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a proper approximation of function FORMULA  and the
bilinear form
FORMULA 
Bilinear form FORMULA  is not based on the conventional one:
FORMULA 
The advantage of our bilinear form is that it always is positive
definite on the weak function space FORMULA , and the
conventional one is not, since the integration by parts does not
hold on weak function space FORMULA  or FORMULA .
Theorem 2.1.   Let FORMULA . Then, the solution of weak finite
element equation (REF ) uniquely exists. 
Proof.   Since equation (REF ) is essentially a linear system
of equations, we only need to prove the uniqueness. Let FORMULA ,
we need to prove FORMULA . Taking FORMULA  in (REF ), we
obtain
FORMULA 
This implies that FORMULA  on FORMULA . Thus, from Lemma
2.1, we know that FORMULA  is a piecewise constant on FORMULA . Since
FORMULA  and FORMULA , so we have FORMULA .  FORMULA

Projection and approximation
In this section,
we give some projections and approximation properties which will
be used in next section.
In order to balance the approximation accuracy between spaces
FORMULA  and FORMULA  used to compute FORMULA , from now on,
we always set the index FORMULA  in (REF )–(REF ). The other
choice of weak finite element space can be found in
{{cite:5841b255-1870-4382-ae86-03f36476c1f2}}, {{cite:842e9a3a-373b-4c87-9562-87d5ade86f72}}.
For FORMULA , let FORMULA  is the local FORMULA  projection operator,
restricted on each element FORMULA , FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
By the Bramble-Hilbert lemma, it is easy to prove that (see
{{cite:7f447392-b89b-486f-b660-40adfea1b00f}})
FORMULA 
We now define a projection operator FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the FORMULA  projection operator in
space FORMULA .
Lemma 3.1.FORMULA    Let FORMULA . Then, FORMULA  has the following
approximation properties
FORMULA 
Proof.   Since FORMULA , then estimate (REF ) follows
from (REF ). Furthermore, from (REF ) and the definition of
FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
This implies FORMULA  and estimate
() holds, noting that FORMULA . FORMULA
For the error analysis, we still need to introduce a special
projection function {{cite:16fa7c47-2efc-43aa-aa0a-045dd39ade8e}}. For simplifying, we only
consider the case of two-dimensional domain (FORMULA ).
Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  (FORMULA ) are the edge and
barycenter coordinate of FORMULA , respectively. For function FORMULA ,
FORMULA . Let
Space FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Define the projection operator FORMULA , restricted
on FORMULA , FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 
Some properties of projection FORMULA  had been
discussed in {{cite:16fa7c47-2efc-43aa-aa0a-045dd39ade8e}}, we here give a more detailed analysis
for our argument requirement.
Lemma 3.2.   For FORMULA ,
the projection FORMULA  uniquely exists and
satisfies
FORMULA 
Furthermore, if FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
Proof.   We first prove the unique existence of
FORMULA . Since the number of dimensions (noting that
(REF ) is trivial for FORMULA ):
FORMULA 
so the linear system of equations (REF )FORMULA () is
consistent. Thus, we only need to prove the uniqueness. Assume that
FORMULA  in (REF )FORMULA (), we need to prove
FORMULA . From (REF )–(), we have
FORMULA  on FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
This implies FORMULA  on FORMULA . So there
exists a function FORMULA  so that FORMULA  (see {{cite:685fe301-55a3-46b2-a8b2-f3c5d81c1e94}}). Since the
tangential derivative FORMULA  on FORMULA , so FORMULA  on FORMULA .
Let FORMULA . Then, FORMULA  and FORMULA . Taking FORMULA  in (), we obtain
FORMULA  so that FORMULA .
Next, we prove (REF )–(). Equation (REF ) comes
directly from the Green formula and (REF )–(). From the
solution representation of linear system of equations
(REF )FORMULA (), it is easy to see that on the reference
element FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where we have used the trace inequality. Then,
(REF ) follows from (REF ) and a scale argument between FORMULA  and FORMULA . From
(REF ), we also obtain
FORMULA 
Hence, estimate () can be derived by using the
Bramble-Hilbert lemma. FORMULA
The following discrete embedding inequality is an analogy of the
Poincaré inequality in FORMULA .
Lemma 3.3.   Let FORMULA  be a polygonal or polyhedral
domain. Then, for FORMULA , there is a positive constant FORMULA 
independent of FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
Proof.   For FORMULA , we first make a smooth domain
FORMULA  ( if FORMULA  is convex, we may set
FORMULA ) and extend FORMULA  to domain FORMULA  by setting
FORMULA . Then, there exists a function
FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
Now we set FORMULA , then FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 
Hence, we have from (REF ), (REF ) and (REF ) that
FORMULA 
where we have used the fact that FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
The proof is completed. FORMULA
A direct application of Lemma 3.3 is the stability estimate of
weak finite element solution FORMULA .
Lemma 3.4.   Let FORMULA  be the solution of problem
(REF ), FORMULA  and FORMULA  the solution of problem
(REF ) with FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then we have
FORMULA 
Proof.   Let FORMULA . Then, from (REF ), we see that
FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 
Taking FORMULA  and noting that FORMULA  and
FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Using embedding inequality (REF ) and the a priori estimate for
elliptic problem (REF ), the proof is completed. FORMULA

Error analysis
In this section,
we do the error analysis for the weak finite element method
(REF ). We will see that the weak finite element method
possesses the same (or better) convergence order as that of the
conventional finite element method.
In following error analysis, we always assume that the data
FORMULA  and FORMULA  in problem (REF ) is smooth enough
for our argument.
Lemma 4.1.   Let FORMULA  be the solution of
problem (REF ). Then we have
FORMULA 
Proof.   Let FORMULA . From Lemma 3.2
and (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
Next, from equations (REF ) and (REF ), we obtain
FORMULA 
Together with (REF ) in which setting FORMULA 
and FORMULA , respectively, we arrive at the conclusion.
 FORMULA
We first give an abstract error estimate for FORMULA  in the discrete FORMULA -norm.
Theorem 4.1.   Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be the solutions of problems
(REF ) and (REF ), respectively, FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Then, we have
FORMULA 
Proof.   From Lemma 4.1, we see that FORMULA  satisfies the equation
FORMULA 
Combining this with equation (REF ), we obtain the error
equation
FORMULA 
Taking FORMULA  in (REF ) and using embedding inequality (REF ), we arrive at the conclusion of Theorem 4.1. FORMULA
By means of Theorem 4.1, we can derive the following error
estimates.
Theorem 4.2.   Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be the solutions of problems
(REF ) and (REF ), respectively, FORMULA , and FORMULA . Then we have the optimal order error
estimates
FORMULA 
In particular, for the pure elliptic problem in divergence form
(FORMULA ) and FORMULA ,
we have the superconvergence estimate
FORMULA 
Proof.   Using the approximation properties (REF )–() and
(), we obtain
FORMULA 
Substituting these estimates into (REF ), we obtain
FORMULA 
Hence, using the triangle inequality
FORMULA 
and approximation property (), estimate (REF ) is derived
for the discrete FORMULA -norm. Since
FORMULA 
then the FORMULA -error estimate follows from the discrete embedding
inequality (REF ), estimates (REF ) and (REF ).
Furthermore, if FORMULA , from Theorem 4.1, we have
FORMULA 
Then, the superconvergence estimate (REF ) can be derived by
using approximation properties () and () and the
triangle inequality. FORMULA
Theorem 4.2 shows that the weak finite element method is a high
accuracy numerical method, in particular, in the gradient
approximation.
From Theory 4.2, we see that, for FORMULA -order finite element, weak
finite element method usually has higher accuracy than other
finite element methods in the gradient approximation. The reason
is that the discrete weak gradient is computed by using
FORMULA -order polynomial. This action will add some computation
expense, but all additional computations are implemented locally,
in the element level, see (REF ) and Section 5.
Below we give a superclose estimate for error FORMULA . To
this end, we assume problem (REF ) has the FORMULA -regularity and consider the auxiliary problem: FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 
From the argument of Lemma 4.2, we know that FORMULA  satisfies
equation:
FORMULA 
Theorem 4.3.   Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  be the solutions of problems
(REF ) and (REF ), respectively, FORMULA . Then we have the following superclose estimate
FORMULA 
and the optimal FORMULA -error estimate
FORMULA 
Proof.   Taking FORMULA  in (REF ), we have
FORMULA 
where we have used embedding inequality (REF ),
estimate (REF ) and the approximation properties of
FORMULA  and FORMULA . Below we only need to
estimate FORMULA . Using error equation (REF ), we
have
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  and FORMULA , then by using
Green's formula and Lemma 3.2, we have
FORMULA 
Similarly, we obtain
FORMULA 
Substituting estimates FORMULA  into (REF ) and combining
(REF ), we arrive at estimate (REF ), noting that
FORMULA . Estimate (REF ) follows from
(REF ) and the triangle inequality.  FORMULA
The difference between estimates (REF ) and (REF ) is that
for getting the FORMULA -order error estimate in the
FORMULA -norm, the regularity requirement in (REF ) is optimal
and lower than that in (REF ).
In order to derive the FORMULA -error estimate, we need to
impose the quasi-uniform condition on partition FORMULA  so that the
finite element inverse inequality holds in FORMULA .
Theorem 4.4.   Assume that partition FORMULA  is quasi-uniform,
and FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the solution of problems (REF ) and
(REF ), respectively, FORMULA . Then, we have
FORMULA 
Proof.   From Theorem 4.3 and the finite element inverse
inequality, we have that
FORMULA 
Hence, by using the approximation property of FORMULA , we
obtain
FORMULA 
The proof is completed.  FORMULA
For two-dimensional problem FORMULA , Theorem 4.4 gives the optimal
order error estimate in the FORMULA -norm.

Numerical experiment
In this section,
we discuss how to solve the weak finite element equation (REF )
and give some numerical examples to illustrate our theoretical
analysis.
Weak finite element linear system of equations
In order to form the discrete linear system of equations from weak
finite element equation (REF ), we first introduce the basis
functions of space FORMULA . Let FORMULA  is a element and FORMULA  is an
edge of FORMULA . Further let FORMULA  be
the basis functions of space FORMULA ,
FORMULA  the basis functions of
space FORMULA  and FORMULA  be
the basis functions of polynomial set FORMULA .
Set the weak basis functions FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Then, we have
FORMULA . By definition (REF ) of discrete weak gradient, we
see that the support set of FORMULA  is in FORMULA 
and the support set of FORMULA  is in FORMULA . Thus, weak finite
element equation (REF ) is equivalent to the following linear
system of equations: FORMULA , FORMULA ,
such that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the restriction of FORMULA  on set FORMULA ,
i.e., all integrals in FORMULA  are restricted on FORMULA . Equations
(REF )–() form a linear system composed of FORMULA  equations with FORMULA  unknowns, where FORMULA  is
the total number of elements in FORMULA .
To solve equations (REF )–(), we need to design a solver
to compute the discrete weak gradient FORMULA  or
FORMULA . According to (REF ), for given
FORMULA  (FORMULA ), FORMULA  can be computed by the following formula
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the vectors associated with
functions FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA , respectively. The matrixes in
(REF ) are as follows
FORMULA 
Now, linear system of equations (REF )–() can be solved
in the following way. We first use formula (REF ) to derive the
linear relation FORMULA . Then, by substituting FORMULA  into equations
(REF )–(), we can obtain a linear system of equations
that only concerns unknowns FORMULA . This linear system can be solved by using a proper linear
solver, in which FORMULA  is computed by formula
(REF ).

Numerical example
Let us consider problem (REF ) with the following data:
FORMULA 
and the source term FORMULA , domain FORMULA .
In the numerical experiments, we first partition FORMULA  into a
regular triangle mesh FORMULA  with mesh size FORMULA . Then, the
refined mesh FORMULA  is obtained by connecting the midpoint of
each edge of elements in FORMULA  by straight line. Thus, we obtain a
mesh series FORMULA . We use the polynomial pair
FORMULA  for space FORMULA  and set
FORMULA  in the weak finite element discretization
(REF ). We examine the computation error in the discrete
FORMULA -norm, the FORMULA -norm and the FORMULA -norm, respectively.
The numerical convergence rate is computed by using the formula
FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the computation
error. Table I give the numerical results. We see that the
convergence rates are consistent with or better than the
theoretical prediction. Then, we further examine the
superconvergence of the weak finite element solution (see Theorem
4.2). We take the data as in (REF ) with FORMULA  and
FORMULA . The desired FORMULA -superconvergence is observed from the
numerical results, see Table II. In particular, from Table I-II,
we see that the numerical convergence rates in FORMULA -norm and
FORMULA -norm are also superconvergent, although we have no such
conclusion in theory.
