Double parton scattering events are directly sensitive
to the correlations between
two partons inside a proton
and can answer fundamental questions on the connections
between the proton constituents.
In this chapter, the different types
of possible correlations,
our present knowledge of them, and the
processes where they are likely to be important,
are introduced and explained.
The increasing integrated
luminosity at the LHC
and the refinements of the theory of
double parton scattering,
lead to interesting prospects for measuring,
or severely constraining, two-parton correlations
in the near future.

Introduction
The study
of double parton scattering (DPS) events can open up a window to see,
for the first time,
how the constituents of the proton are connected to each other.
The correlations between the properties of
two partons in one proton can be directly probed,
measuring how two partons inside the proton affect
one another. So far, only indirect
tests of these correlations have been possible,
studying for example, by means of electromagnetic interactions,
how the collective
behavior of the constituents sums up
to give the proton spin.
This allows us to answer questions such as:
How does the probability to find one parton in a certain spin state
affect the probability to find the second parton in the same spin state?
In this chapter we
will look at two quarks or gluons inside the proton,
explain the different ways they can be connected to one another,
describe the state-of-the-art of the field
as well as the perspectives for future studies of these correlations.
This will be possible in
processes where DPS forms a major contribution, such as
same-sign double-FORMULA  production.
Assuming factorization (see Ref. Diehl:book),
the DPS cross section for the production of
final states FORMULA  and FORMULA  takes the form
{{cite:58e75461-5ec5-4770-b897-b65c38d0c074}}, {{cite:236d65ec-f9f1-41d5-8283-e12dc2c677c9}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA 
if FORMULA  = FORMULA , FORMULA  otherwise, FORMULA  denotes the different possible
color representations and
FORMULA  label simultaneously the species (parton-type and flavor)
and polarization of the partons contributing
to the production of the final states. In Eq. (REF ),
FORMULA  represents the differential partonic cross section
(for example, differential in the rapidities of the
produced particles).
The functions FORMULA 
are the double parton distributions (dPDFs),
encoding the probability to find the two interacting
partons, with longitudinal
fractional momenta FORMULA  at a relative transverse distance
FORMULA  inside the proton.
They depend additionally
on factorization scales FORMULA , and for FORMULA , on
a rapidity scale {{cite:58e75461-5ec5-4770-b897-b65c38d0c074}}. If extracted from data,
as noticed a long time ago {{cite:a5a6c9c2-864a-4eb7-987a-13de8d14bb6d}},
dPDFs would offer for the first time
the opportunity to investigate two-parton correlations.
This would be a two-body property,
carrying information
which is
different and
complementary to that encoded in
one-body distributions, such as generalized parton distributions
(GPDs) {{cite:4c6d3878-6d6a-4b71-9d98-94d3ab966041}}.
This is illustrated in figure REF .
For cross sections differential also in the net
transverse momenta of each of the
two hard interactions, the dPDFs are replaced in the factorization theorem
by the
double transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (dTMDs).
These distributions
depend on two additional transverse vectors
and allow for
a number of further correlations, for example between the spin and transverse
momenta of the partons. They are interesting also from a
more theoretical point of view, with the rich color structure in combination with the non-trivial dependence
on the soft gluon exchanges {{cite:a6060330-dbe6-4136-9c02-89f321226c7f}}.
In the region where the two net transverse momenta are small,
DPS and single parton scattering (SPS)
both contribute to the cross section at the same power, which makes
it promising for DPS extractions.
However, for simplicity
we will focus on the dPDFs during the rest of this chapter.
In the following, we will have a closer look at what is currently known about the
different correlations, describe the effects
expected in cross sections and the prospects
for their measurement. The chapter is structured as follows:
In the next section, we will look at the correlations
between the kinematic variables FORMULA  and FORMULA  of the dPDFs.
In section 3, we will focus instead on the correlations
between color, spin, flavor and fermion number of
the two partons.
In section 4 we will summarize and give an outlook to what we
consider are the most promising future directions.

Kinematic correlations
As stressed in the introduction, the two-body information
encoded in dPDFs is different and complementary to that
described by one-body parton distributions.
Nevertheless, a connection between dPDFs,
presently largely unknown, and
one-body quantities can be obtained by making
a number of assumptions on the dPDFs.
First, all color representations
different from the color singlet are neglected
(i.e., only FORMULA  is considered),
together with all possible
correlations between spins, flavors and fermion-numbers.
Thereafter, correlations between FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are neglected. The dPDFs then take the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a parton
distribution dependent on the impact parameter
FORMULA , the transverse distance of
the parton from the transverse center of mass of the hadron
{{cite:4c6d3878-6d6a-4b71-9d98-94d3ab966041}}.
This function is the Fourier transform
of a GPD in a process where
the momentum transfer is transverse.
Neglecting moreover correlations between FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA , one can write
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a parton distribution
function (PDF) and the transverse profile
FORMULA  has been assumed to be equal
for all parton species.
One should notice that
Eq. (REF ) has been
found to fail in all model calculations of GPDs (see, e.g.,
Refs.
{{cite:142533f4-f363-454b-8fe1-0d8676d277dd}}, {{cite:05f95b04-f71b-4ce1-9e00-34eb215d3903}}),
as well as in the first analyses of
data from deeply virtual Compton scattering {{cite:cd7eb27d-4f46-403d-8655-a17f5df92d03}}.
The assumptions
described above are often used to infer
properties of dPDFs from those of single particle distributions.
FIGURE 
Since dPDFs are largely unknown, and only
sum rules relating them to PDFs are available
{{cite:3ee418ae-3c0e-4d2b-8d78-6a464f721486}}, {{cite:74c3ba56-7866-4209-aeb4-383467709ad7}}, {{cite:d28f633f-4a91-4794-b874-f4a3f5f34a5c}}, {{cite:05cc428e-143e-4d4c-b88b-470d6dc62be5}},
model calculations can be very useful and have been performed.
Models
are usually developed at low energy, but are able
to reproduce some relevant features of nucleon parton
structure.
Since in models the number of degrees of freedom
is fixed,
they can be predictive in particular in the valence region,
at FORMULA  larger than, say, 0.1.
In such model calculations, the factorized structures in
Eqs. (REF ) and (REF ) do not arise.
Relevant correlations between FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
violating Eq. (REF ),
and between FORMULA  and FORMULA , violating Eq. (REF ),
have been found in the valence region in a variety
of approaches. This result was obtained, for example, in
a modified version of the simplest bag model
{{cite:f48e113e-b389-4224-9d9a-00722cb537bf}}, in constituent
quark models {{cite:c544400d-1908-4aa1-8191-95f1e1946a30}}, {{cite:5cd48950-49c9-4f6f-a8ce-4c5b3e5ef7a5}} in a valon model
{{cite:bd0bb687-ed31-4ffb-929c-88f842f17d44}}
and in dressed
quark models {{cite:a9f802ab-1dbd-4c5b-bd5e-f657ba689ad0}}.
FIGURE 
In particular, in Ref. Rinaldi:2014ddl
a light-front (LF)
Poincaré covariant approach,
reproducing the essential sum rules of dPDFs
without ad hoc assumptions and containing
natural two-parton correlations, has been described.
An example of the information that model calculations
can provide is shown in Fig. REF , where
the effect of the breaking of the factorization between
longitudinal and transverse variables is emphasized.
It is crucial to explore
if the breaking of the properties,
Eqs. (REF ) and (REF ), found
in the valence region, survive at LHC kinematics,
dominated by low-FORMULA  and high energy scales.
As a matter of fact, model estimates are valid in general
at a low scale
FORMULA , the so-called hadronic scale.
The results of the calculations
should therefore be evolved using perturbative QCD (pQCD)
in order to compare them with data taken at a momentum scale
FORMULA , according to a well established procedure, proposed already
in Refs. {{cite:74d5bf62-1232-436b-ad99-108d60dc36b2}}, {{cite:25cf7a62-55fe-4ceb-873b-1c1e1fec9590}}.
The evolution of dPDFs has been
studied for a long time.
The first studies were performed in the late '70s/early '80s{{cite:750a2d5b-f96d-49e8-9871-249729da71e1}}, {{cite:f48c9400-d2b1-4c19-ae83-14dab68c0306}} with much theoretical progress being made in recent years – for a detailed discussion on this topic we invite the reader to look at Ref. Diehl:book.
One should notice that, even if a factorized structure of the dPDF
were valid at a given scale, the different evolution properties
of dPDFs and PDFs would break it at a different scale,
generating perturbative correlations.
These correlations
have been discussed in a largely model-independent way in Ref.
Diehl:2014vaa, incorporating the homogeneous evolution equations.
The evolution tends to pull the average transverse separation in quark
and gluon distributions towards a common value,
but this is a relatively slow process and differences can remain up
to high scales. Similarly, correlations between the momentum fractions
and the transverse separation present at a low scale can remain in
large scale processes, as described here below.
The interplay of perturbative and non-perturbative
correlations between
different kind of partons has been described also using
homogeneous QCD evolution
applied to the results of the correlated LF model {{cite:14df4421-c661-4d68-9e6f-1c811518be0f}}.
It was found that their effect tends
to be washed out at low- FORMULA  for the valence,
flavor non-singlet distributions, while they can affect
singlet distributions in a sizable way.
This different behavior can be understood
in terms of a delicate interference of non-perturbative correlations,
generated by the dynamics of the model, and perturbative ones,
generated by the model independent evolution procedure.
Concerning the correlation between the FORMULA 
and FORMULA  dependences in dPDFs,
some qualitative understanding can be inferred
from studies of hard exclusive processes,
involving
FORMULA  of a single parton inside the proton. In particular,
measurements of FORMULA  at HERA
{{cite:db433932-ce72-4878-b18d-33e978fd6a53}}, {{cite:759b7821-9d5e-4301-ad11-8b28b619fdcd}} indicate a logarithmic dependence
FORMULA  with
FORMULA  for gluons with FORMULA . Studies of nucleon form factors
{{cite:805d2b93-702e-422f-986e-066b360f72d2}} and
calculations of Mellin moments FORMULA  with
FORMULA  in lattice QCD {{cite:3b2dbeee-84ca-4c6b-b20d-d03b2beaec7c}} indicate that for FORMULA  above
FORMULA  the decrease of FORMULA  with FORMULA  is even
stronger. Although this is one-body
information,
one could wonder whether the
correlations between the FORMULA 
dependence and FORMULA  in double
parton distributions could follow the behavior
of the one-body quantity,
with the FORMULA  distribution becoming more
narrow with increasing FORMULA .
If this is the case,
important consequences could be expected
for multiparton interactions
{{cite:c03531e0-e045-4c3b-9f88-ff6c18eba30d}}.
The production
of hard final states requires relatively
large momentum fractions of the partons entering the corresponding hard
interaction. This would favor
small values of FORMULA , which is the
transverse distance of the parton from the transverse
center of the proton.
The collision would therefore be rather central
and thus the
transverse interaction area for the colliding protons
would be rather large,
a fact which in turn favors
additional interactions.
Such
correlations may have a sizable impact, e.g., on the underlying
event activity in FORMULA  production,
as shown in a study with Pythia 8
{{cite:af39ae7a-2079-4ad3-bb61-eec2a75e432c}}.

Quantum-number correlations
Two partons inside a single proton can have their quantum numbers
correlated. Perhaps the most straightforward example comes from the
valence sector of the proton. If we, for one interaction,
extract one valence up quark from the proton, it is natural to expect
that the chance to find another valence up quark in the proton is reduced.
It seems reasonable to expect such effects to be sizable at relatively large
momentum fractions and to reduce as the density of partons increases
towards small momentum fractions. This phenomenon naturally fits into the
dPDFs, FORMULA , of two partons FORMULA  and FORMULA 
inside a proton.
We will focus here on another type of correlation and interference which
occurs at the quantum level, and for which we reserve the label
quantum-number correlations. This includes correlations and
interferences in color, spin, flavor and fermion number
{{cite:3ce20558-02e0-4d04-9213-37c62b8980f1}}, {{cite:f4723665-a942-4831-ac39-4dba2af3ea91}}, {{cite:b86af071-3d09-46ef-907c-5dff75579a4b}}.
Understanding how this occurs in double parton scattering,
but not in single parton scattering, is not complicated.
From a diagram such as the one in figure REF , we can see that
two quarks leave the right-moving proton
(represented by the lower green ellipse) on the left side of the final-state
cut and two quarks return to the proton on the right side of the cut.
The quantum numbers of the two quarks in the amplitude have to sum up to
the quantum numbers in the conjugate amplitude, which still leaves
room for the two quarks in the amplitude to individually have different
quantum numbers from their partners in the conjugate amplitude.
FIGURE 
In particular, this allows for quantum number interferences, which is another
way of viewing the correlations. If we take color as example
(even though, as we will see, it might not have the largest impact),
and couple each parton in the amplitude with its partner in the conjugate
amplitude (i.e. parton with the same longitudinal momentum fraction FORMULA )
we have two possible combinations:
FORMULA .
Repeating this with the other pair we obtain

(3 3)(3 3) = (11) (1 8) (8 1) (8 8) = 1 1 ...

where the "..." refer to combinations that do not produce a total color
singlet. The requirement that the sum of the quantum numbers on the left
and right side of the final-state cut have to be equal amounts to the
requirement that when coupling all four partons, we need to obtain a color
singlet. We therefore see that for the quark case we can obtain the
singlet in two ways: either by coupling two individual color singlet
pairs or by
coupling two color octet pairs. This results in two independent
double quark distributions for the two color states in Eq. REF , labeled as FORMULA 
with FORMULA . In the cross section, both distributions contribute and
color-singlet production is proportional to
FORMULA  (with the normalization of the
distributions as in {{cite:dac84e58-10a4-4bf8-bd73-823d6f6964f0}}). The color-octet term
has hard interactions with color interferences between the amplitude and
conjugate, i.e. it is a genuine quantum effect which can never
appear in a single hard scattering. Under the
assumption of zero correlations between the two hard interactions, no such
interference could take place and the octet distributions would vanish.
Similar to the color, also the spin of the two partons can be correlated and
give rise to a large number of different polarized dPDFs.
There can be interferences in flavor, for example between up and down quarks
in double-FORMULA  boson production. This type of interference is illustrated by the
diagrams in figure REF .
FIGURE 
Furthermore, there can be interference in fermion number between quarks,
antiquarks and gluons as examplified in figure REF .
FIGURE 
It is interesting to note, that
spin correlations leading to distributions
of transversely polarized quarks and linearly polarized gluons
have a
rather unique signature. They induce a dependence on the azimuthal angle
(for example between the FORMULA -boson decay planes) and lead to azimuthal spin
asymmetries in unpolarized proton scattering {{cite:2528baa1-f41d-4b49-a321-554280379c6c}}. It is important to realize that experimental extractions of DPS signals are based on Monte Carlo generators which assume a flat azimuthal distributions, which might no longer be true in the presence of correlations.
The result of all the correlations is a flora of independent double parton distributions, of which we have little knowledge and no experimental extractions. One might question what predictive power we have, and can hope to obtain. The answer to this question leads us into a discussion of what we know about the different correlation effects, when they are likely to play an important role and when we believe they can be safely neglected. The information available to this end comes from two main categories of studies. The first studies the distributions in different types of hadron models, or derives theoretical bounds, and attempts to quantify the size of the correlations. The second examines how the perturbatively calculable evolution of these distributions influences their shapes and sizes.
Models and bounds
There are a couple of different hadron model calculations which consider
different quantum-number correlations. Focus has been on the polarization of the partons (apart from the kinematic correlations already discussed)
and large correlations have been observed.
For quark and antiquark distributions, large spin correlations were found in the MIT bag model {{cite:f48e113e-b389-4224-9d9a-00722cb537bf}} and in light-front constituent quark models {{cite:5cd48950-49c9-4f6f-a8ce-4c5b3e5ef7a5}}. The domain of validity of these models is principally the region of large momentum fractions, and thus they serve best as initial conditions to the double DGLAP evolution equations. This was done in {{cite:5cd48950-49c9-4f6f-a8ce-4c5b3e5ef7a5}} with the observation that the spin correlations are sizable even after evolution. Within a dressed-quark model of the mixed quark-gluon distributions, the spin
correlations
were observed to be large for certain polarization types, such as two longitudinally polarized partons and the combination of a transversely polarized quark and an unpolarized gluon {{cite:a9f802ab-1dbd-4c5b-bd5e-f657ba689ad0}}. In addition to model calculations, theoretical upper bounds on the correlations, including spin, flavor, fermion number and color, have been derived from the probability interpretation (or positivity) of dPDFs {{cite:7b9761c9-e0ac-49e9-b453-60fde2784b7f}}, {{cite:649e9262-6f3d-4cef-9390-bc4387b04223}}.

Evolution
The dPDFs evolve according to a double ladder version of the DGLAP evolution equations, i.e. a double DGLAP evolution {{cite:58e75461-5ec5-4770-b897-b65c38d0c074}}. Cross talk between the ladders is suppressed by the large distance FORMULA  separating the two partons, which is typically of the size of the proton. The evolution starts at a scale of the order of
FORMULA  and evolves up to the scale of the respective hard interaction{{cite:23e59966-90d1-4049-b4dd-f4d3844d2b66}}. This evolution generically leads to a reduction of the correlations between the two partons and decreases the importance of the two interference/correlation dPDFs. However, the rate at which this occurs varies significantly for the different types of correlations and the momentum fractions of the partons.
If we allow for a slight oversimplification, the current state of
knowledge can be summarized in a short paragraph: The color correlations are
Sudakov suppressed and expected to be small in large-scale processes{{cite:3ce20558-02e0-4d04-9213-37c62b8980f1}}, {{cite:ac1d53c3-dd21-419d-badb-116b567d406a}}, {{cite:6ce3e7d8-f653-4a01-9ed7-89bfbc2fccac}}. This can be understood from the fact that those correlations require color information to travel over the large distance FORMULA  inside the proton. Therefore, for processes above FORMULA  they are expected to play a minor role.
Gluon polarizations at low momentum fractions (where DPS is most relevant) are also quite rapidly suppressed through the evolution. This suppression can be understood from the gluon splitting kernels: The unpolarized gluon splitting kernel at small FORMULA  goes as FORMULA , leading to the large increase of the gluon density for small momentum fractions (as is well known from single parton distributions). The polarized splitting kernels on the other hand go as FORMULA  for longitudinal polarization and FORMULA  for linearly polarized gluons. The quark polarizations on the other hand can remain sizable up to high scales{{cite:3fcb2040-bf50-4358-908d-cf6dc6462d8b}}. Figure REF  shows two examples of the suppression for the most suppressed gluon polarization and the least suppressed quark polarization, starting with maximal polarization (i.e. polarized equal to unpolarized) at the input scale of 1 GeV. Fermion-number interference is expected to be small at large scales, since the interference distributions do not mix with the gluon distributions (which drives the evolution at small to moderate FORMULA ) under leading order evolution and always involve color interference. Flavor interference on the other hand is still relatively unexplored, but also does not mix with the gluon distributions.
FIGURE 

Prospects
We have seen that two-parton correlations are very interesting
properties of the non-perturbative proton structure, and they can
be relevant in specific DPS channels.
So far, it has been challenging to
observe them at the LHC and
extract dPDFs from data.
While waiting for precise data expected from LHC
at high luminosity in the near future,
one could look for signatures of the presence of correlations
in an extracted quantity,
the so-called effective
cross-section, FORMULA .
Let us introduce now this quantity.
Since dPDFs are largely unknown,
it has been useful
to describe DPS cross sections independently of dPDFs, through the
approximation
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the SPS
cross section with final
state FORMULA :
FORMULA 
The physical meaning of Eq. (REF ) is that,
once the process FORMULA  has occurred with cross section FORMULA ,
the ratio FORMULA  represents the probability of process FORMULA 
to occur.
So far, a constant value of FORMULA 
has been assumed in
the experimental analyses performed.
In this way, different collaborations have extracted values of
FORMULA , analyzing events with
different final states and with different
center-of-mass energies of the hadronic
collisions. The results have large error bars
and their central values vary
in the range FORMULA  mb (see, for example,
Figures 8 and 9 in {{cite:74d088e2-2588-4837-b371-6ae04e0ff4ee}}). However,
these numbers are to be taken with
caution as the different extractions rely on different assumptions,
for example,
with regards to the SPS cross sections.
It is interesting
to realize that
the approximations leading to Eq. (REF ),
with a constant FORMULA ,
from Eq. (REF ), are the same leading the dPDF to
its full factorized form.
As a matter of fact,
by inserting Eqs. (REF ) and (REF )
into Eq. (REF ),
one obtains
FORMULA  from Eq.
(REF ) and (REF ) as follows:
FORMULA 
with the quantity
FORMULA 
controlling the
double parton interaction rate.
The fact that FORMULA  does not show any dependence on
parton fractional momenta, hard scales or parton species,
is clearly a consequence of the assumptions in Eqs. (REF )
and (REF ).
If those assumptions were relaxed
FORMULA  would explicitly depend on
scales and flavors, and on all momentum fractions,
and would be a complicated average
(with FORMULA  dependent weights) of all the correlations
described by the double parton distributions.
One could therefore
analyze data looking for such a dependence.
Besides, model calculations show that
correlations in momentum fractions
cannot be treated separately from
those involving also FORMULA :
the way the dPDF differs from the product of
single parton densities changes with FORMULA 
{{cite:5cd48950-49c9-4f6f-a8ce-4c5b3e5ef7a5}}, {{cite:d7a909aa-bb7b-4514-9256-fc722833ba8b}}.
Using model calculations
without the assumptions leading to Eqs. (REF )
and Eq. (REF ),
FORMULA  was found to depend
non-trivially on longitudinal momenta.
In particular, this was obtained in the LF
constituent quark model
{{cite:6445e1fa-6512-43be-8a53-eabcd7ec8674}},
as well as
in a holographic approach {{cite:73cf2814-404a-4cf1-bcdf-f8b9cc1b281c}}.
Very recently, the LF model calculation of dPDFs
has been used to evaluate the cross section for
same-sign FORMULA  boson pair production, a promising channel to look for
signatures of double parton interactions at the LHC.
In this way, the average value of the DPS cross section
was found to be
in line with previous estimates
which make use of a constant FORMULA  as an external parameter,
not necessary in this approach. The novel obtained dependence
on longitudinal momenta
addresses the possibility to observe
two-parton correlations, in this channel,
in the next LHC runs {{cite:e973931e-ad80-41b2-94c2-04f19223b2c2}}.
An example of these results is shown in Fig.
REF .
FIGURE 
Since in the DPS cross section the dependence upon
FORMULA  is integrated over,
a direct test of the breaking of Eq. (REF ) in DPS,
addressing correlations between FORMULA 
and FORMULA  in dPDFs, appears difficult at the moment.
An indirect test of these correlations is expected
from future measurements at Jefferson Lab, COMPASS and at a possible
future electron-ion collider
{{cite:75b57259-e2ed-4dbe-bb4b-3eef5fcc998c}}, where at least
a detailed picture of the one-body distribution
FORMULA , should be at hand.
As for the correlations between quantum numbers described
in the previous section,
their impact on cross sections has been studied only in
a limited number of cases. For the production of two FORMULA  mesons,
as measured by LHCb {{cite:b13dceae-1d89-4c94-83da-8fb375ef89b2}},
the low masses of the final states allows for a large impact
on the size of the cross section
from longitudinally polarized gluons,
reaching a contribution of up to
50% of the unpolarized {{cite:3c4bb6d4-405c-4d9f-a38e-535ca26dea43}}.
This is an example of the importance of further
exploratory studies of
DPS
to find channels and phase space regions
in which two-parton correlations are more pronounced
and easily measured.
In this sense, input is expected also from proton-nucleus
scattering, where the DPS contribution is known to be enhanced
{{cite:33794de7-1199-4205-b691-12c008560dda}}.
There are several
elements working together to provide a promising
near future for DPS in general, and measurement of correlations in
particular. 1) The
continuous refinements of the DPS theory, including for example a
scheme to combine, without double-counting, the SPS and DPS cross sections
described in Ref. Diehl:book,
2) The increasing integrated luminosity collected by the experiments
at the LHC and 3) The improved precision to which the SPS cross sections
are known. Combined, this provides good reasons to further develop
the theory for DPS, motivation for phenomenological studies
of the effects correlations have on actual observables, and good
prospects for interesting experimental results to confront the theory
with in the upcoming years.
Double TMDs enter cross sections when the transverse momenta of
for example two vector bosons are measured and small.
In this region, there is no factorization theorem
without considering both single and double parton scattering.
The formalism to treat this region in both single and double parton
scattering {{cite:a6060330-dbe6-4136-9c02-89f321226c7f}}, will allow for interesting prospects
to investigate the correlations in DPS, including those between
the transverse momenta of the two partons.
The experimental searches have now measured same-sign double-FORMULA  production {{cite:003bf2fe-e157-4280-a7b9-82714b03ad25}},
often put forward as the
cleanest signal for DPS.
Interesting results are expected
also in channels
where the separation between single and double parton scattering is
less straightforward. An increased precision on both DPS
and SPS sides
will lead to a situation where the double parton distributions are
the main unknown. Using differential calculations
and resummation at high logarithmic accuracy, for example in double
boson production, the combination of DPS and SPS will be important
and comparisons to data will enable
extractions of dPDFs and interparton correlations,
or experimentally constrain them.
In summary, the increased luminosity will allow for more differential measurements. Moving towards a theory that allow for more complete phenomenological explorations, simultaneously treating both SPS and DPS, provides the basis for our belief that inter-parton correlations might soon be an experimentally established fact, or a heavily constrained hypothesis.
