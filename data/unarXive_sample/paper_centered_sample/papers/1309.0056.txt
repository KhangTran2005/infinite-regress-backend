Introduction
The study of abelian gauge theory on FORMULA  led string theorists to discover an interesting symmetry, the electric-magnetic duality, which inverts the coupling constant and extends to an action of FORMULA . This FORMULA  symmetry was later studied over the more general 4-manifolds, some with specific topological twists, where it was called FORMULA -duality , say in the context of FORMULA  supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. The FORMULA -duality is roughly saying that certain 4-dimensional gauge theories are modular invariant under the action of the FORMULA . This modular invariance can be tested by studying the partition function of the theory, roughly speaking, measuring the Euler characteristic of the instanton moduli space of that theory. One of interesting results by string theorists in {{cite:04830ddb-aba5-4acb-b600-7280cee1d37e}} was to show that the topological quantum field theories obtained by the so-called (topologically) twisted super Yang-Mills theories over the four manifold and their associated partition functions are equivalent to Donaldson's theory of four manifolds and the associated partition function of Donaldson's invariants. These interesting consequences of S-duality, later set base for much further developments, such as the correspondence between the supersymmetric black hole entropies and FORMULA  super Yang-Mills theories {{cite:3dc41760-8f72-4741-97a2-40265528ea8c}}. Recently the study of the conjectural modular properties of the BPS partition functions of the supersymmetric D4-D2-D0 black holes {{cite:bb5e8e27-6703-4795-ad56-f98af992d3fb}}, {{cite:18f87c87-049b-4e49-96c0-3effe7daf8cd}} motivated algebraic geometers to construct a mathematical framework for modeling the D4-D2-D0 BPS states and prove the modularity properties of their associated partition functions, using purely algebraic-geometric techniques. The current article is the third in the sequel, after {{cite:564d5739-4651-4219-9574-3e20c783ab37}} and {{cite:a309edfe-f99e-46ee-afe1-2abfe823035a}}, of the authors' attempt to achieve this goal where here, the focus of the study is to specifically compute the D4-D2-D0 BPS invariants via computing their mathematical counterpart given by the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of torsion sheaves in an ambient Calabi-Yau threefold.
Let FORMULA  be a smooth projective Calabi-Yau threefold. For a pure sheaf FORMULA  the Hilbert polynomial is defined to be FORMULA , and the reduced Hilbert polynomial of FORMULA  is
FORMULA 

FORMULA  is called Gieseker semistable if for any proper subsheaf FORMULA  we have FORMULA  for FORMULA . FORMULA  is called Gieseker stable if the equality never holds for any proper subsheaf FORMULA .

FORMULA  is called FORMULA -semistable if for any proper subsheaf FORMULA  we have FORMULA . FORMULA  is called FORMULA -stable if the equality never holds for any proper subsheaf FORMULA .

For a fixed FORMULA , a pair FORMULA , where FORMULA  is a nonzero section of FORMULA , is called stable ({{cite:abd3b8bf-3df4-4a67-89cc-07804e1673b7}}) if

FORMULA  is Gieseker semistable,

if FORMULA  factors through a proper subsheaf FORMULA  then FORMULA  for FORMULA .  FORMULA


The stability of pairs has originated from the stability of the coherent systems defined by Le Potier {{cite:253cd090-8fa4-4011-a88e-f4f5b5e00865}}. The reduced Hilbert polynomial of the pair FORMULA  is defined to be
FORMULA 
where and FORMULA . Now if FORMULA , define FORMULA  to be the restriction of FORMULA  if FORMULA  factors through FORMULA , and otherwise define FORMULA . Now the pair FORMULA  is stable if and only if for any proper subsheaf FORMULA ,  FORMULA
Suppose now that FORMULA  is a proper moduli space of Gieseker stable sheaves FORMULA  (or the moduli space of stable pairs FORMULA ) as above with fixed Hilbert polynomial FORMULA . The moduli space FORMULA  is usually singular and may have several components with different dimensions. To define (deformation invariant FORMULA -valued) invariants FORMULA  as integration over FORMULA  we need to have a virtual fundamental class of the moduli space constructed by means of a perfect obstruction theory on FORMULA . This can be obtained by studying the deformations and obstructions of the stable sheaves or the stable pairs {{cite:05e8bbe2-17bc-470e-bc6e-b8780c2d827c}}, {{cite:ed71d673-1e5e-4635-b76b-6d09aacb7e2a}}, {{cite:65b5a92c-89d6-48ec-acdf-3f15d1246835}}, {{cite:a4751472-c069-4c81-a423-d964f7a799a4}}.
Moreover, the obstruction theory on FORMULA  is symmetric and the corresponding invariants are expressible as a weighted Euler characteristic of the moduli space {{cite:a75cb3eb-8f2a-43e7-b363-7f261b1257a9}}.
If the moduli space of Gieseker semistable sheaves FORMULA  contains strictly semistable sheaves, then one cannot define the invariants FORMULA  by means of the virtual fundamental class.
Joyce and Song {{cite:abd3b8bf-3df4-4a67-89cc-07804e1673b7}} instead define the FORMULA -valued invariants for FORMULA  called the generalized DT invariants FORMULA  which are given by the “stacky” weighted Euler characteristic of the moduli space of semistable sheaves. Joyce-Song stable pairs theory {{cite:abd3b8bf-3df4-4a67-89cc-07804e1673b7}} provides a tool to compute the so-called stacky Euler characteristics, by using the sophisticated motivic wall-crossing techniques developed by Joyce {{cite:63a47bdc-8a50-45a8-a9c5-5afd1038a1f9}}, as well as Kontsevich and Soibelman in {{cite:0a987661-956f-4b3d-8065-bd0dff7d0091}}. In other words, the main idea is to benefit from the, easier to calculate, Joyce Song pair invariants to compute the generalized DT invariants. The latter can be done by obtaining a wall-crossing identity between the the elements of the Hall algebra of the motivic ring of stack functions of the moduli space of stable pairs and the moduli space of semistable sheaves respectively. After taking the stacky Euler characteristics of both sides of this identity, one obtains the wall-crossing identity between the pair invariants and the generalized DT invariants. Note that, FORMULA  specializes to FORMULA  if there are no strictly semistable sheaves and moreover, FORMULA  is also deformation invariant.
We study the case where FORMULA  is the total space of the canonical bundle of FORMULA  and FORMULA  is the moduli space of semistable sheaves with Hilbert polynomial FORMULA . Any semistable sheaf FORMULA  with Hilbert polynomial FORMULA  is (at least set theoretically) supported on the zero section of FORMULA , and FORMULA  is equal to FORMULA  times the class of the zero section. We relate FORMULA  to the topological invariants of the moduli space of torsion-free semistable sheaves on FORMULA . Using the wall-crossing formula of Joyce-Song {{cite:abd3b8bf-3df4-4a67-89cc-07804e1673b7}} and the toric methods of {{cite:37fc8816-4269-4d15-943f-7dff3c31b6c1}}, {{cite:bba9cb3f-ece1-436a-8191-98e6e833a364}} we find a formula for FORMULA  when FORMULA  in the presence of strictly semistable sheaves. To express the main result, let FORMULA  be the moduli space of rank 2 Gieseker semistable sheaves on FORMULA  with Hilbert polynomial FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be the open subset of stable sheaves. Denote by FORMULA  the Hilbert scheme of FORMULA  points on FORMULA . Then we prove
Theorem 1 
Let FORMULA  where FORMULA ,

If FORMULA  is an odd number then FORMULA .

If FORMULA  is an even number then
FORMULA 

where FORMULA  is a combinatorial expression (cf. Theorem REF ) taking into account the contribution of indecomposable strictly semistable sheaves.


FORMULA  is in general a rational number in the presence of semistable sheaves. Joyce and Song in {{cite:abd3b8bf-3df4-4a67-89cc-07804e1673b7}} define the corresponding BPS invariants denoted by FORMULA  by the following formula:
FORMULA 
Joyce and Song conjecture that FORMULA  is an integer. In the case that there are no strictly semistable sheaves with Hilbert polynomial FORMULA  we have FORMULA .

Proof of Theorem  REF
Let FORMULA  be the total space of FORMULA  over FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is a quasiprojective Calabi-Yau threefold, called local FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the pullback of FORMULA  from FORMULA , and let FORMULA  denote the zero section. We identify the compactly supported cohomology groups of FORMULA  with the cohomology groups of FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Using this identification, let FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  be respectively the classes of FORMULA , a line and a point on FORMULA .
The Hilbert polynomial (with respect to FORMULA ) of a 2-dimensional compactly supported coherent sheaf FORMULA  on FORMULA  with the compactly supported Chern character
FORMULA 
is given by
FORMULA 
Any such FORMULA  is set theoretically supported on FORMULA . Moreover, we have
Lemma 2.1 
If FORMULA  as above is semistable Whenever we mention (semi)stability of sheaves, unless otherwise is specified, we always mean Gieseker (semi)stability., then FORMULA  is scheme theoretically supported on FORMULA  and hence
FORMULA 
the moduli space of rank FORMULA  semistable sheaves on FORMULA  with Hilbert polynomial FORMULA .

The ideal sheaf of FORMULA  in FORMULA  is isomorphic to FORMULA , hence we get the exact sequence
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is semistable, the first morphism in the sequence above is necessarily zero and hence FORMULA .
Note that for any stable torsion-free sheaf FORMULA  on FORMULA  we have FORMULA  by Serre duality and the negativity of FORMULA . Therefore, if FORMULA  is such that there are no strictly semistable sheaves on FORMULA  with Hilbert polynomial FORMULA , then the moduli space FORMULA  is un-obstructed and smooth of dimension
FORMULA 
where as a sheaf on  FORMULA
FORMULA 
In this case the Behrend's function is determined by FORMULA  {{cite:a75cb3eb-8f2a-43e7-b363-7f261b1257a9}}, and hence
FORMULA 
The generating function of the Euler characteristic of the moduli space of FORMULA -stable torsion-free sheaves on FORMULA  is known for FORMULA , by the results of {{cite:f16dd2f3-4419-4584-8798-4c60eeb6a980}}, {{cite:f25109ec-1cd0-4234-870a-768c62d9f541}}, {{cite:d8dd9f70-6d47-4182-b653-65fd1af7dfb2}}, {{cite:29e94276-b7d7-4ee9-b688-7da9f6f61c20}}, {{cite:04830ddb-aba5-4acb-b600-7280cee1d37e}} and they all have modular properties. Here is the summary of these results:

FORMULA . By tensoring with FORMULA  we can assume that FORMULA . So then FORMULA , the Hilbert scheme of FORMULA  points on FORMULA , which is smooth of dimension FORMULA . Note that in this case there are no strictly semistable sheaves on FORMULA  with Hilbert polynomial FORMULA , so by {{cite:d8dd9f70-6d47-4182-b653-65fd1af7dfb2}}
FORMULA 

FORMULA  By tensoring with FORMULA  we can assume that either FORMULA  or FORMULA . If FORMULA  then there are no strictly semistable sheaves with the corresponding Hilbert polynomial FORMULA  (and FORMULA -stability is equivalent to Gieseker stability) and hence FORMULA  is smooth of dimension FORMULA  so by {{cite:f16dd2f3-4419-4584-8798-4c60eeb6a980}}
FORMULA 

When FORMULA , there are strictly semistable sheaves with Hilbert polynomial FORMULA  only when FORMULA .
If FORMULA  then FORMULA  is smooth of dimension FORMULA . So for  FORMULA
FORMULA 
We will study the case FORMULA  in more detail in what follows in this section.

FORMULA  We can assume again that FORMULA  or 2. In the latter two cases FORMULA  has no strictly semistable sheaves (and FORMULA -stability is equivalent to Gieseker stability) and there is a modular formula for the generating function FORMULA  in terms of the generating function of the Euler characteristics of FORMULA  computed in {{cite:f16dd2f3-4419-4584-8798-4c60eeb6a980}}.

In the following we compute FORMULA  in the presence of semistable sheaves when FORMULA . By the discussion above strictly semistable sheaves only occur if FORMULA  and FORMULA . Let
FORMULA 
be the corresponding Hilbert polynomial. We use the moduli space of stable pairs in the sense of {{cite:abd3b8bf-3df4-4a67-89cc-07804e1673b7}}.
For FORMULA , let FORMULA  be the moduli space of stable pairs FORMULA  where FORMULA  is a semistable sheaf of rank 2 with Hilbert polynomial (REF ), and FORMULA  is a nonzero section of FORMULA . The stability of pairs further requires that if FORMULA  is a proper subsheaf of FORMULA , such that FORMULA  factors through FORMULA , then the Hilbert polynomial of FORMULA  is strictly less than the Hilbert polynomial of FORMULA . By {{cite:abd3b8bf-3df4-4a67-89cc-07804e1673b7}} FORMULA  admits a symmetric perfect obstruction theory. Let FORMULA  be the corresponding pair invariants. Note that, even though FORMULA  is not proper, FORMULA  is proper (as all the semistable sheaves are supported on FORMULA ) so FORMULA  is well defined. Alternatively, FORMULA .
Lemma 2.2 
 FORMULA

This is a direct corollary of the wall-crossing formula {{cite:abd3b8bf-3df4-4a67-89cc-07804e1673b7}} by noting two facts. Firstly, the only decomposable semistable sheaves with Hilbert polynomial FORMULA  are of the form FORMULA  where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the push forwards to FORMULA  of the ideal sheaves of the 0-dimensional subschemes FORMULA  of length FORMULA . Secondly, the Euler form FORMULA .
Remark 2.3 Note the polynomial on the right hand side of Lemma REF  is a rational number independent of FORMULA .
 FORMULA

There is a natural morphism FORMULA  that sends a stable pair FORMULA  to the FORMULA -equivalence class of FORMULA . Note that FORMULA  is singular at a point corresponding to a strictly semistable sheaf. However, we have
Proposition 2.4 
FORMULA  is a smooth scheme of dimension FORMULA .

We denote by FORMULA  the 2-term complex FORMULA  corresponding to a stable pair FORMULA . By the stability of pairs FORMULA  has to be a semistable sheaf and hence Lemma REF  implies that
FORMULA 
the moduli space of the stable pairs on FORMULA . The Zariski tangent space and the obstruction space at a FORMULA -point FORMULA  are then identified with FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively. Consider the following natural exact sequence:
FORMULA 

Since FORMULA , we have FORMULA  for FORMULA .
We also know that FORMULA  by Serre duality and the semistability of FORMULA . So the exact sequence above firstly implies that FORMULA  which means that FORMULA  is unobstructed and hence smooth, and secondly
FORMULA 
By Proposition REF , and noting that FORMULA  (see (REF )), we have
Corollary 2.5 
FORMULA .
 FORMULA

We will find FORMULA  using toric techniques. According to {{cite:f16dd2f3-4419-4584-8798-4c60eeb6a980}}, a torsion-free FORMULA -equivariant sheaf FORMULA  on FORMULA  corresponds to three compatible FORMULA -families, FORMULA  one for each of the standard FORMULA U1,U2,U3FORMULA P2FORMULA mFORMULA  identified with FORMULA , FORMULA , the eigenspace corresponding to FORMULA  in the space of sections of FORMULA  on FORMULA .

FORMULA -family for a  FORMULA

For any FORMULA  we have FORMULA  if FORMULA  is below the horizontal axis, on the left of the vertical axis, or inside the partition FORMULA . Otherwise, FORMULA .
Moreover, we have (see {{cite:bba9cb3f-ece1-436a-8191-98e6e833a364}})
FORMULA 
A FORMULA FFORMULA P2FORMULA -equivariant line bundle) is determined by a FORMULA -family given by

an integer FORMULA ,

three nonnegative integers FORMULA ,

a 1-dimensional subspace FORMULA  one for each FORMULA  (if FORMULA  we set FORMULA ),

six 2d partitions FORMULA  for FORMULA .

Definition 2.6 We call a FORMULA -family corresponding to a FORMULA FFORMULA P2FORMULA p1,p2,p3 FORMULAFORMULA 
Figure REF  indicates the corresponding FORMULA -family FORMULA  in the case FORMULA  are pairwise distinct each diagram corresponds to the FORMULA -family FORMULA  on FORMULA .. The points indicated by FORMULA  have the coordinates FORMULA , respectively. The partitions FORMULA  are placed respectively at the points (indicated by FORMULA ) with the coordinates
FORMULA 
FIGURE 
Figure REF , indicates a typical degenerate case in which FORMULA . Everything is the same as in the non-degenerate case except that we reposition the partitions FORMULA  to respectively the points with the coordinates FORMULA  Similarly if FORMULA  (respectively FORMULA ) then we reposition the partitions FORMULA  (respectively FORMULA ) to the points with the coordinates FORMULA  (respectively FORMULA ). Finally, if FORMULA  then we bring all the partitions to the point with new coordinates (indicated by FORMULA ).
FIGURE 
For any FORMULA , we denote by FORMULA  the vertical and the horizontal strips made by two vertical and two horizontal lines in each diagram:
FORMULA 
etc. We also denote by FORMULA  the areas located above the horizontal strip and to the right of the vertical strip:
FORMULA 
etc. We then have (we use the convention FORMULA )

FORMULA  if either FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  is on the left of the strip FORMULA , or FORMULA  is below the strip FORMULA .

FORMULA , FORMULA .

FORMULA  if FORMULA  is in FORMULA .

Suppose that FORMULA  then FORMULA  if FORMULA  or if FORMULA  belongs to a connected component of FORMULA  adjacent to a member of FORMULA ; and FORMULA  if FORMULA  or if FORMULA  belongs to a connected component of FORMULA  adjacent to a member of FORMULA .
Suppose that FORMULA  then FORMULA  if FORMULA  or if FORMULA  belongs to a connected component of FORMULA  adjacent to a member of FORMULA .

FORMULA  where FORMULA  is an arbitrary 1-dimensional subspace of FORMULA  for all FORMULA  in any connected component of FORMULA  other than the ones mentioned in (F4). We denote these connected components by FORMULA , and denote by FORMULA  the corresponding 1-dimensional subspaces.

Remark 2.7 It can be seen that the FORMULA {p1,p2,p3, s1,...,sk}FORMULA -equivariant sheaf with non-degenerate FORMULA -family obviously satisfies this condition regardless of the subspaces FORMULA .
 FORMULA

Definition 2.8 By a FORMULA -family data FORMULA  we mean the collection of

an integer FORMULA ,

nonnegative integers FORMULA ,

six possibly empty 2d partitions FORMULA ,

the set FORMULA .

Note that in a FORMULA -family data we do not specify FORMULA , but we only keep track of whether they are distinct or not. Given a FORMULA -family data FORMULA  we define FORMULA  to be the number of nonzero elements of the set FORMULA .
 FORMULA

In terms of FORMULA -family data (see {{cite:bba9cb3f-ece1-436a-8191-98e6e833a364}})
FORMULA 

As a result, the FORMULA -family of the FORMULA FFORMULA FFORMULA FFORMULA -equivariant sheaves FORMULA  for any nonzero FORMULA , to be the maximal subsheaves of FORMULA  respectively with
FORMULA 

Similarly, if FORMULA  is given by a degenerate FORMULA -family we can define FORMULA  to be the maximal rank 1 subsheaf generated by the FORMULA .
We are only interested in the case where the Hilbert polynomial of FORMULA  is FORMULA , so we must have
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Then one can see that FORMULA  is Gieseker (semi)stable if the Hilbert polynomial of FORMULA  is less than (less than or equal to) FORMULA  for FORMULA  (see {{cite:bba9cb3f-ece1-436a-8191-98e6e833a364}}). Similarly FORMULA  is FORMULA -(semi)stable if the linear term of the Hilbert polynomial of FORMULA  is less than (less than or equal to) to the linear term of FORMULA  for FORMULA .
A closed point of  FORMULA
For a fixed FORMULA  and FORMULA  (compatible with FORMULA ), any closed point of FORMULA  gives rise to a  FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA FFORMULA -equivariant sheaf with FORMULA -family data FORMULA  Note that 1-dimensional subspaces of FORMULA  can be identified with the closed points of  FORMULA.
Example 2.9 
In this example we consider a  FORMULA FORMULA FORMULA FORMULA FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA FFORMULA P(m)=m2+3m FORMULA FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA =(u,v,w) FORMULA FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA l(,)=0 FORMULAFORMULA l(,)=1 FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA P(5)=40FORMULA In order to determine the morphism FORMULA , we in addition need to specify a 1-dimensional subspace FORMULA .
Note that FORMULA  given by this data is strictly semistable if the Hilbert polynomial of FORMULA  is equal to FORMULA . Therefore, the pair is stable if and only if FORMULA . This means that if FORMULA  then there is at most one choice for FORMULA ; but if FORMULA  then FORMULA  can be any point in FORMULA . So the space of possible FORMULA  can be either FORMULA , a point, or FORMULA . We assign the weight 0 or 1 to a lattice point FORMULA  depending on respectively the first or second possibility occurs, and we assign the weight 1 to each FORMULA . With these new weights, one can check that the count of FORMULA  and FORMULA  in each diagram is P(5)/2=20.

FIGURE 
 FORMULA
In order to get a bijection between the closed points of  FORMULA
We define FORMULA , and denote by FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  the locally closed subspaces of FORMULA  where the corresponding underlying sheaves FORMULA  are respectively decomposable, indecomposable strictly semistable, and stable. Given any two FORMULA -compatible triple of integers FORMULA , it is not hard to verify the following properties:

FORMULA  is empty or an isolated point,

FORMULA ; we denote the common value by FORMULA .

FORMULA ; we denote the common value by FORMULA .

In the following proposition we determine the contributions of each of the above items to the Euler characteristc FORMULA  (FORMULA  as in (REF )).

Remark 2.11 
In the case that FORMULA  is a non-degenerate FORMULA -family and
FORMULA 
for any pairwise distinct FORMULA ,
it is easy to find FORMULA  and FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be a FORMULA -compatible triple of integers with FORMULA . Since FORMULA  are nonzero and pairwise distinct by assumption FORMULA , and we have
FORMULA 
In fact in this case, FORMULA , and
FORMULA  because by the FORMULA -action one can fix FORMULA  to be respectively FORMULA  and then
FORMULA 
can be arbitrary.  FORMULA

Using Lemma REF  and Proposition REF , we prove the following result evaluating the DT invariants of FORMULA  corresponding to the rank 2 torsion-free sheaves on FORMULA :
Theorem 2.12 
Let FORMULA  where FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be the open subset of the stable sheaves.

If FORMULA  is an odd number then FORMULA .

If FORMULA  is an even number then
FORMULA 


(1) is already proven (see the discussion at the beginning of this section). It also follows from our toric description, as only FORMULA  is nonzero for any relevant FORMULA -family data FORMULA . We now prove (2).
By Lemma  REF
FORMULA 
FORMULA  is the sum of the contributions of three types of  FORMULA FORMULA FORMULA
FORMULA 
Now the formula in the theorem is obtained by adding all these contributions.
This also finishes the proof of Theorem REF .
Remark 2.13  Let FORMULA  be the Hilbert polynomial corresponding to FORMULA  then by Remark REF  FORMULA  is the number of 9-tuples
FORMULA 
of positive integers FORMULA  and 2d partitions FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
It is not hard to see that
FORMULA 
From this we get
FORMULA 
This is in agreement with {{cite:f16dd2f3-4419-4584-8798-4c60eeb6a980}} which uses a slightly different argument.
In order to find FORMULA  appearing in Theorem REF  we need to add to the formula above the contribution of the Gieseker stable sheaves which are not FORMULA -stable. This means that one of the indequlaities in Remark REF  must turn into an equality FORMULA  and we must also allow for the degenerate FORMULA -families.  FORMULA

In the following examples we compute FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  in the cases FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA .
Example 2.14  FORMULA. In this case the only semistable sheaf with Hilbert polynomial FORMULA  is isomorphic FORMULA . Therefore, by Proposition REF  part (1) we have FORMULA , and hence by Lemma REF  and noting that FORMULA  we get
FORMULA
