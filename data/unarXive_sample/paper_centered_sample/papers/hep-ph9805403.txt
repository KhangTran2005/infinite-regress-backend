Abstract

We present estimates of the direct (in decay amplitudes) and indirect
(mixing-induced) CP-violating asymmetries in the
non-leptonic charmless two-body
decay rates for FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  decays and
their charged conjugates,
where FORMULA  is a light
pseudoscalar (vector) meson. These estimates are based on a generalized
factorization approach making use of next-to-leading order
perturbative QCD contributions
which generate the required strong phases. No soft final state interactions
are included. We study the dependence of the
asymmetries on a number of input parameters and show that there are at least
two (possibly three) classes of decays in which the asymmetries
are parametrically stable in this approach. The decay modes of particular
interest are:
FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Likewise, the CP-violating asymmetry in the decays FORMULA  with
FORMULA 
is found to be parametrically stable and large. Measurements of
these asymmetries will lead to a determination of the phases FORMULA  and FORMULA  and we work out the relationships
in these modes in the
present theoretical framework. We also show the extent of
the so-called “penguin
pollution” in the rate asymmetry FORMULA  and of the “tree
shadow” in the asymmetry FORMULA  which will effect
the determination of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  from the respective measurements.
CP-violating asymmetries in FORMULA  decays depend on a model parameter
in the penguin-amplitudes and theoretical predictions require
further experimental or theoretical input.
Of these, CP-violating asymmetries in FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are potentially interesting and are studied here.

Introduction
Recent measurements by the CLEO Collaboration {{cite:8597515b-b661-4de5-9c3e-603fdced89b5}}, {{cite:52ee9ff5-3ab7-484a-9d30-522f4ce406a6}} of a
number
of decays FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are light hadrons
such as FORMULA ,
have lead to renewed theoretical
interest in understanding hadronic FORMULA  decays {{cite:0df88e6c-ba38-4816-97c9-5e8390f7e3f4}}.
In a recent work {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} we have calculated the branching fractions of
two-body non-leptonic decays FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are the lowest lying light pseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively.
The theoretical framework used was based on the next–to-leading logarithmic
improved effective Hamiltonian and a factorization Ansatz for the
hadronic matrix elements of the four-quark operators {{cite:90079d3d-644b-4f92-aa8c-9473ac396045}}.
We worked out the parametric dependence of the decay rates using currently
available information on the weak mixing matrix elements, form factors,
decay constants and quark masses.
In total we considered seventy six decay channels with a large fraction of
them having branching ratios of order FORMULA  or higher which hopefully
will be measured in the next round of experiments on FORMULA  decays.
The recently measured decay modes FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are shown to be largely in agreement with the
estimates based on factorization ?Citation `akl98-1' on page 1 undefined–?Citation `acgk' on page 1 undefined.
This encourages us to further pursue this framework and calculate
quantities of experimental interest in two-body non-leptonic FORMULA  decays.
Besides branching fractions, other observables which will help to
test the factorization approach and give information on the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix {{cite:8d452c33-189a-498c-9cab-e5fe788e5fb4}} are CP-violating rate
asymmetries in partial decay rates.
In the past a large variety of ways has been proposed to observe CP
violation in FORMULA  decays {{cite:07c92346-265d-4114-8338-8742386a6dd4}}.
One method is to study CP-violating asymmetries
in the time-dependence of the neutral FORMULA  meson decay rates in specific
modes, which involve an interference between two weak amplitudes.
Asymmetries in charged FORMULA  decays require an interference between two
amplitudes involving both a CKM phase and a final state strong
interaction phase-difference.
Such asymmetries occur also in decays of neutral FORMULA  mesons in which
FORMULA  and FORMULA  do not decay into common final states or where
these states are not CP-eigenstates.
In these decays the weak phase difference arises from the superposition of
various penguin contributions and the usual tree diagrams in case they
are present.
The strong-phase differences
arise through the absorptive parts of perturbative penguin diagrams (hard
final state interaction) {{cite:e2c778e2-d897-4c86-b6d7-7cfd35514416}} and non-perturbatively
(soft final state interaction).
When a FORMULA  and FORMULA  decay to a common
final state FORMULA , FORMULA -FORMULA  mixing plays a crucial role in determining
the CP-violating asymmetries, requiring time-dependent measurements.
For the final states which are both CP-eigenstates and involve only one
weak phase in the decays, the CP-violating asymmetry is independent of the
hadronic matrix elements.
This occurs in the well studied FORMULA  decays
making it possible to extract
the value of FORMULA  with no hadronic uncertainties.
For neutral FORMULA  decays into two light mesons such a direct translation of
the CP-violating asymmetries in terms of CP-violating phases FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  will not be possible, in general.
Hence, the predicted asymmetries are subject to hadronic uncertainties.
In principle, these uncertainties can be removed by resorting to a set
of time-dependent and time-independent measurements as suggested in the
literature ?Citation `GL90' on page 1 undefined–?Citation `DH94' on page 1 undefined. In practice, this program requires a number
of difficult measurements. We pursue here the other alternative, namely
we estimate these uncertainties in a specific model, which can be tested
experimentally in a variety of decay modes.
CP-violating asymmetries are expected in a large number of FORMULA 
decays; in particular the partial rate asymmetries in all the
FORMULA  decay modes and their charge conjugates studied in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}
are potentially interesting for studying CP violation.
We recall that CP-violating asymmetries in FORMULA  decays
have been studied earlier in
the factorization framework {{cite:07c92346-265d-4114-8338-8742386a6dd4}},?Citation `sw' on page 1 undefined–?Citation `dg97' on page 1 undefined.
With the measurement of some of the FORMULA  decays
{{cite:8597515b-b661-4de5-9c3e-603fdced89b5}}, {{cite:52ee9ff5-3ab7-484a-9d30-522f4ce406a6}}, some selected modes have received renewed interest
in this approach ?Citation `dds97-1' on page 1 undefined–?Citation `Petrov97' on page 1 undefined. These papers, however, make
specific assumptions about FORMULA  (here FORMULA  is the number of
effective colors) and certain other input parameters;
in particular, the earlier ones used CKM-parameter values which are now
strongly disfavored by recent unitarity fits {{cite:4bcbe205-7f17-4148-91c2-9e8f885f0db9}}, {{cite:71518117-9536-473c-818d-2cf9dbaf8a0b}}
and/or they do not include the anomaly contributions (or not quite
correctly) and the latter ones make specific
assumptions about FORMULA , which may or may not be consistent with data on
FORMULA  decays. We think it is worthwhile to study again these
CP-violating asymmetries by including theoretical improvements
{{cite:90079d3d-644b-4f92-aa8c-9473ac396045}}, {{cite:4c45ea92-5d74-42df-95cb-2256d314b4ab}} and determine their FORMULA -and other parametric dependences.
Following our previous work {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} we study this on the basis of the
factorization approach.
We consider the same seventy six decay channels as in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} and
calculate
the CP-violating asymmetries for charged and neutral FORMULA  decays with the
classification
I to V as in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} to distinguish those channels which can be
predicted with some certainty in the factorization approach. These are the
class-I and class-IV (and possibly some class-III) decays, whose decay
amplitudes
are FORMULA -stable and which do not involve delicate cancellations among
components of the amplitudes. In our study here, we invoke two
models to estimate the form factor dependence of the asymmetries,
study their dependence on the effective
coefficients of the QCD and electroweak penguin operators in term of FORMULA ,
the dependence on FORMULA , the virtuality of the gluon, photon or Z
in the penguin amplitudes decaying into
the quark-antiquark pair FORMULA  in FORMULA 
and, of course, the CKM parameters. The last of these
is the principal interest in measuring the CP-violating asymmetries.
Our goal, therefore, is to identify, by explicit calculations, those decay
modes whose CP-violating asymmetries are relatively insensitive to the
variations of the rest of the parameters.
In this pursuit, the sensitivity
of the asymmetries on FORMULA  is a stumbling block. As the branching
ratios are relatively insensitive to the parameter FORMULA , this
dependence can be removed only by the measurement of at least one of the
CP-violating asymmetries sensitive to it (examples of which are abundant),
enabling us to predict quite a few others. A mean value of FORMULA  can also be
estimated in specific wave function models {{cite:73b0362c-70bb-4366-83a5-9939098d76a9}} - an alternative, we
do not consider here. However, quite interestingly, we show that a number of
class-I and class-IV (hence FORMULA -stable) decays involving FORMULA 
mesons have CP-violating asymmetries which are also stable against
variation in FORMULA . Hence, in this limited number of decays, the asymmetries
can be reliably calculated within the factorization framework.
We find that the CP-violating asymmetries in the
following decays are
particularly interesting and relatively stable: FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Likewise, the CP-violating asymmetry in the decays FORMULA  with FORMULA  is
large as the individual decay modes have the same intrinsic CP-parity.
The FORMULA -dependences in the individual asymmetries in this sum, which are
small to start with but not negligible, compensate each other resulting
in a CP-violating asymmetry which is practically independent of FORMULA .
Ideally, i.e., when only one decay amplitude dominates, the
asymmetries in the mentioned decays measure one of
the CP-violating phases FORMULA  and FORMULA . In actual decays, many
amplitudes are present and we estimate their contribution in the
asymmetries. To quantify this more pointedly, we work out the dependence of
the time-integrated partial rate asymmetry FORMULA  in the
decays FORMULA  on FORMULA  and show the extent
of the so-called “penguin pollution". Likewise, we work out the dependence
of FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  on FORMULA . We also study the effect
of the tree contribution - which we call a “tree shadow" of the
penguin-dominated amplitude, on FORMULA .
The CP-violating asymmetries in FORMULA  decays are in general
FORMULA -dependent.
Supposing that this can be eventually fixed, as discussed above, the
interesting
asymmetries in FORMULA  decays in our approach are:
FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA . We study the asymmetries in the mentioned decays and also in
FORMULA  in detail in this paper.
The effects of
soft final state interactions (SFI) may influence some (or
all) of the estimates presented here for the asymmetries. By the same token,
decay rates are also susceptible to such
non-perturbative effects ?Citation `DGPS96' on page 1 undefined–?Citation `DLWZ98' on page 1 undefined, which are, however,
notoriously
difficult to quantify. We think that the role of SFI in FORMULA 
decays will be clarified already as the measurements of the branching ratios
become more precise and some more decays are measured. Based on the “color
transparency" argument {{cite:3855aa0e-a3c5-44ea-ba79-0464333f712a}}, we subscribe to the point of view
that the effects of SFI are subdominant in decays whose amplitudes are not
(color)-suppressed. However, it should be noted that the effects of the
so-called non-perturbative “charm penguins" {{cite:8491cee6-02c1-4b1f-95a6-d78803935964}}
are included here in the factorization approach in terms of the
leading power (FORMULA ) corrections which contribute only to the decays
FORMULA  involving an FORMULA  or FORMULA  {{cite:4c45ea92-5d74-42df-95cb-2256d314b4ab}}, as
explained in the next section.
This paper is organized as follows:
In section 2 we review the salient features of the generalized factorization
framework used in estimating the FORMULA  decay rates in
{{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}. In section 3
we give the formulae from which the various CP-violating asymmetries
for the charged and neutral FORMULA  decays are calculated.
Section 4 contains the numerical results for the CP-violating
coefficients, required for time-dependent measurements of the
CP-violating asymmetries in FORMULA  and FORMULA  decays, and
time-integrated CP-violating asymmetries. The numerical results are
tabulated for three specific values of the effective number of colors
FORMULA , varying FORMULA  in the range FORMULA , and two sets of the CKM parameters. We show the
CKM-parametric dependence of the CP-violating asymmetries for some
representative
decays belonging to the class-I, class-III and class-IV decays, which
have stable asymmetries and are
estimated to be measurably large in forthcoming experiments at FORMULA  factories
and hadron machines.
Finally, in this section we study some decay modes which
have measurable but FORMULA -dependent CP-violating asymmetries, mostly
involving FORMULA  decays but also a couple of FORMULA  decays.
Section 5 contains a summary of our results and conclusions.

Generalized Factorization Approach and Classification of FORMULA  Decays
The calculation of the CP-violating asymmetries
reported here is based on our work described in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.
There, we started from the short-distance effective weak Hamiltonian
FORMULA  for FORMULA  and FORMULA  transitions.
We write below FORMULA  for the FORMULA  transitions with five active
quark
flavors by integrating out the top quark and the FORMULA  bosons:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA ; FORMULA  are the Wilson coefficients evaluated at the
renormalization scale FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the
CKM matrix elements for which we shall use the Wolfenstein
parameterization {{cite:aee5b741-8ac5-4a79-9ac8-8b3a2845542c}}. The operators FORMULA  and FORMULA 
with FORMULA 
are the current-current four-quark operators inducing the FORMULA  and FORMULA  transitions, respectively. The rest of
the operators are the QCD penguin operators
(FORMULA ), electroweak penguin
operators (FORMULA ), and FORMULA  represents the chromo-magnetic
penguin operator.
The operator basis for FORMULA  is given in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} together with
the coefficients FORMULA , ..., FORMULA , evaluated in NLL precision, and
FORMULA , ..., FORMULA  and FORMULA , evaluated in LL precision.
Effects of weak annihilation and W-exchange diagrams have been neglected.
Working in NLL precision, the quark level matrix elements of FORMULA 
are treated at the one-loop level.
They can be rewritten in terms of the tree-level matrix
elements of the effective operators with new coefficients
FORMULA 
(For details see {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} and the references quoted therein.).
The effective coefficients FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ,
and FORMULA 
have no absorptive parts to the order we are working.
The effective coefficient FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  contain contributions of penguin diagrams with insertions of
tree operator FORMULA , denoted by FORMULA  and FORMULA  in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} and with
insertions of the QCD penguin operators FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  (denoted by
FORMULA  in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}).
These penguin-like matrix elements have absorptive parts which generate the
required strong phases in the quark-level matrix elements.
The contributions FORMULA  and FORMULA  depend on the CKM matrix elements.
All three functions FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  depend on quark masses, the scale
FORMULA , and FORMULA , and are given explicitly in eqs. (10), (11) and (14),
respectively, of ref. {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.
Having defined FORMULA  in terms of the four-quark operators FORMULA  and
their effective coefficients FORMULA  the calculation of the hadronic
matrix elements of the type FORMULA 
proceeds with the generalized
factorization assumption {{cite:b1892cd7-7fad-4214-a546-b03aeb7e7554}}.
The result of this calculation for the various FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA 
decays are written down in detail in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.
The hadronic matrix elements depend on the CKM matrix elements, which contain
the weak phases, the form factors and decay constants of current matrix
elements, various quark masses and other parameters. The quantities FORMULA ,
given in terms of the effective short-distance coefficient FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  runs from FORMULA ,
are of central phenomenological importance.
The terms in eq. (REF ) proportional to FORMULA  originate from
fierzing the operators FORMULA  to produce quark currents to match the quark
content of the hadrons in the initial and final state after adopting the
factorization assumption.
This well-known procedure results in general in matrix elements with the
right flavor quantum number but involves both color singlet-singlet and
color octet-octet operators.
In the naive factorization approximation, one discards the color
octet-octet operators.
This amounts to having FORMULA  in (REF ).
To compensate for these neglected octet-octet and other non-factorizing
contribution one treats FORMULA  in
eq. (REF ) as a phenomenological
parameter. In theory, FORMULA  can be obtained only by fully calculating the
octet-octet and other non-factorizing contributions and can, in principle,
be different for each of the ten FORMULA .
Starting from the numerical values of the ten perturbative short distance
coefficients FORMULA  (FORMULA ) we investigated in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}
the FORMULA 
dependence of the ten effective coefficients FORMULA  for the four types of
current-current and penguin induced decays, namely FORMULA  (FORMULA ) and FORMULA  (FORMULA ).
It was found, that FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are rather stable
with respect to variations of FORMULA  in the usually adopted interval FORMULA  (or FORMULA ) for all four types of transitions, whereas
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  depend very much on FORMULA .
Based on this result we introduced a classification of factorized amplitudes
which is an extension of the classification for tree decays in {{cite:a68385f6-aeff-4c75-995b-a0e4acfd1ac7}}
relevant for FORMULA  decays involving charmed hadrons.
These classes I, II, III, IV and V are fully described in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} and
will be used also in this work.
The classes I, II and III in the decays FORMULA  are defined as in
previous work {{cite:a68385f6-aeff-4c75-995b-a0e4acfd1ac7}}. They involve dominantly (or only) current-current
transitions.
Class IV and V involve pure penguin or penguin-dominated decays.
The classification is such, that decays in classes I and IV are
stable against variations of FORMULA , whereas decays in classes II and V depend
strongly on FORMULA  and decays in class III have an intermediate status,
sometimes depending more, sometimes less on FORMULA .
We concluded in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} that decay rates in the classes I and IV
decays can be predicted in the factorization approximation.
The decays in class II and V have sometimes rather small weak transition
matrix elements, depending on the values of the effective FORMULA  and
CKM matrix elements. This introduces delicate cancellations which makes
their amplitudes rather unstable as a function of FORMULA .
Predicting the decay rates in these
classes involves a certain amount of theoretical fine-tuning, and hence we
are less sure about their estimates in the factorization approach.
Depending on the value of FORMULA , it is probable that other contributions
not taken into account in the factorization approach used in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}},
like annihilation, W exchange or soft final state interactions, are
important. We expect that the matrix elements of the decays in class-I and
class-IV (and most class-III), being dominantly of FORMULA  as far as their
FORMULA -dependence is concerned will be described, in the first approximation,
by a universal value of the parameter FORMULA . We are less sure that this will
be the case for class-II and class-V decays. As we show here, this
FORMULA -sensitivity of the decay rates reflects itself also in estimates
of the CP-violating rate asymmetries.
There is also an uncertainty due to the non-perturbative penguin
contributions {{cite:8491cee6-02c1-4b1f-95a6-d78803935964}}, as we do not know how to
include their effects in the amplitudes FORMULA  from first principles. However, these
effects can be calculated as an expansion in FORMULA  in the factorization
approach.
The dominant diagram contributing to the power corrections is the process
FORMULA , which was calculated in the
full theory (Standard Model) in {{cite:9fd1a5aa-2775-4c26-9632-a53ed4958242}}. In the operator product
language which we are using, this contribution can be expressed as
a new induced effective Hamiltonian {{cite:4c45ea92-5d74-42df-95cb-2256d314b4ab}}:
FORMULA 
where the operator FORMULA  is defined as:
FORMULA 
with FORMULA ,
and FORMULA  being the QCD field strength tensor.
This formula holds for on-shell gluons
FORMULA , and the sum over the color indices
is understood. The function
FORMULA  is defined as {{cite:4c45ea92-5d74-42df-95cb-2256d314b4ab}}:
FORMULA 
The FORMULA  gives a non-local contribution but
one can expand the function FORMULA  in FORMULA  for
FORMULA  and the leading
term in this expansion can be represented as a higher dimensional
local operator.
In fact, it is just the chromo-magnetic analogue of the operator
considered by Voloshin {{cite:e968d60e-329f-43f3-ae6c-7806fb120642}} to calculate the power (FORMULA 
corrections in the radiative decay FORMULA . Now comes the
observation made in {{cite:4c45ea92-5d74-42df-95cb-2256d314b4ab}} that in
the assumption of factorization, only the states which
have non-zero matrix elements FORMULA 
contribute to the FORMULA  corrections in the decay rates for FORMULA .
For FORMULA , this
matrix element is determined by the QCD anomaly, and FORMULA  also
gets fixed with FORMULA  which justifies
the expansion.
For the decays
FORMULA , the FORMULA  effects
were calculated in {{cite:4c45ea92-5d74-42df-95cb-2256d314b4ab}}
in the decay rates. For the two-body FORMULA  decays, these are
the only FORMULA  contributions in the factorization approach.
They are included here in the estimates
of the rates and the asymmetries. Note that as the function FORMULA  has no absorptive part, there is no phase
generated by the anomaly contribution in FORMULA 
decays.
Concerning the actual estimates of
the FORMULA  matrix elements in the factorization approximation, we
note that they are
calculated as in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} using two different theoretical approaches
to calculate the form factors.
First, we use the quark model due to Bauer, Stech and Wirbel {{cite:a68385f6-aeff-4c75-995b-a0e4acfd1ac7}}.
The second approach is based on lattice QCD and light-cone QCD sum
rules. The specific values of the form factors and decay constants
used by us and the references to
the literature are given in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.
The implementation of the FORMULA  mixing
follows the prescription of {{cite:90079d3d-644b-4f92-aa8c-9473ac396045}}, {{cite:4c45ea92-5d74-42df-95cb-2256d314b4ab}}.
Of particular importance for calculating the CP-violating asymmetries is
the choice of
the parameter FORMULA ,
which appears in the quantities FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  in the effective
coefficients FORMULA .
Due to the factorization assumption any information on FORMULA  is lost when
calculating two-body decays, except for the anomaly contribution as
discussed earlier.
In a specific model and from simple two-body kinematics
the average FORMULA  has been estimated to lie in the range FORMULA  {{cite:73b0362c-70bb-4366-83a5-9939098d76a9}}. In {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} it was found that the branching ratios
(averaged over FORMULA  and FORMULA  decays) are not sensitively dependent on FORMULA 
if varied in the vicinity of FORMULA . Based on earlier work
{{cite:c70bb541-a22f-4bea-bf2b-67eb9d17297e}}, we do not expect the same result to hold for the asymmetries.
Therefore, we calculated the CP-violating asymmetries by varying FORMULA  in
the range FORMULA  GeVFORMULA ,
which should cover the expected range of FORMULA  in
phenomenological models. Quite interestingly, we find that a number of decay modes
in the class-I and class-IV decays have asymmetries which are insensitive to
the variation of FORMULA . These then provide suitable avenues to test the
assumption that strong interaction phases in these decays are dominantly
generated perturbatively.

CP-Violating Asymmetries in FORMULA  Decays - Formalism
For charged FORMULA  decays the CP-violating rate-asymmetries
in partial decay rates are defined as follows:
FORMULA 
As these decays are all self-tagging, measurement of these CP-violating
asymmetries
is essentially a counting experiment in well defined final states.
Their rate asymmetries require both weak and strong phase differences in
interfering amplitudes.
The weak phase difference arises from the superposition of amplitudes from
various tree (current-current) and penguin diagrams.
The strong phases,
which are needed to obtain non-zero values for FORMULA  in (REF ),
are generated by final state interactions.
For both FORMULA  and FORMULA  transitions, the strong phases
are generated in our model
perturbatively by taking into account the full NLO corrections,
following earlier suggestions along these lines {{cite:e2c778e2-d897-4c86-b6d7-7cfd35514416}}.
CP-violating Asymmetries Involving FORMULA  Transitions
For the FORMULA , and the charge conjugated FORMULA , transitions, the respective decay amplitudes FORMULA  and
FORMULA ,
including the weak and strong phases, can be generically written as:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
Here we denote by FORMULA 
the contributions from the current-current operators proportional
to the effective coefficients FORMULA  and/or FORMULA ; FORMULA , FORMULA 
and FORMULA  denote the contributions from penguin operators proportional to
the product of the CKM matrix elements FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
respectively. The corresponding
strong phases are denoted by FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
respectively.
Working in the standard model,
we can use the unitarity relation FORMULA 
to simplify the above equation (REF ),
FORMULA 
where we define
FORMULA 
Thus, the direct CP-violating asymmetry is
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
In the case of FORMULA  transitions the weak phase entering in FORMULA  is
equal to FORMULA , as we are using the Wolfenstein approximation
{{cite:aee5b741-8ac5-4a79-9ac8-8b3a2845542c}} in which FORMULA  has no weak phase and the phase of
FORMULA  is FORMULA . Thus, the weak phase dependence factors out in an
overall FORMULA  in FORMULA . Despite this,
the above equations for the CP-violating asymmetry FORMULA  are quite
involved due to the fact
that several strong phases are present which are in general hard to
calculate except in specific models such as the ones being used here.
However, there are several small parameters involved in the numerator and
denominator given above. Expanding in these small parameters,
much simplified forms for FORMULA  and FORMULA  and hence FORMULA  can be
obtained in specific decays.
First, we note that FORMULA , with an upper bound FORMULA .
In some channels, such as FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ,
typical
value of the ratio FORMULA  is of FORMULA , with both FORMULA  and FORMULA 
comparable with typically FORMULA .
The importance of including the contributions proportional to FORMULA  has
been stressed earlier in the literature {{cite:fbcd18ce-4a77-4dd6-a4d4-24803cbdd78b}} (see, also
{{cite:7de51455-e694-4f7c-8d66-48aea22fef4e}}, {{cite:20f004cb-4041-4926-9bfb-953ff04c405b}}).
These estimates are based on perturbation theory but the former
inequality FORMULA  should hold generally as the top quark
contribution is genuinely short-distance. The other inequality can
be influenced by non-perturbative penguin contributions. However, also in
this case, for the mentioned transitions, we expect that FORMULA 
should hold. Using these approximations, eq. (REF ,
REF ) become simplified:
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
The CP-violating asymmetry in this case is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , where we use the notation
used in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.
This relation was suggested in the context of the decay FORMULA  by
Fleischer and Mannel {{cite:99b89d58-0dc8-4343-ac5d-b151779c1dbd}}.
Due to the circumstance that the suppression due to FORMULA  is
stronger than the enhancement
due to FORMULA , restricting the value of FORMULA , the CP-violating
asymmetry for these kinds of decays are
O(10%).
To check the quality of the approximation made in eq. (),
we have calculated the CP-violating asymmetry using this formula for FORMULA ,
which yields FORMULA  at FORMULA , very close to the value FORMULA  in
Table 5 calculated using the full formula, with FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in both cases. The results for other values of FORMULA  are similar.
Thus, we conclude that
eq. () holds to a good approximation in the factorization
framework for the decays mentioned earlier on.
However, the CP-violating asymmetries FORMULA  in the mentioned decays
are found to depend on FORMULA , making their theoretical predictions
considerably uncertain. These can be seen in the various tables for
FORMULA .
Of course, the relation (REF ) given above, and others given below,
can
be modified through SFI - a possibility we are not entertaining here.
There are also some decays with vanishing tree contributions, such as
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA . For these decays,
FORMULA , and FORMULA , then for these decays
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
The CP-violating asymmetry is
FORMULA 
Without the FORMULA  contribution, the suppression due to both FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is much stronger and the CP-violating asymmetries are only
around
FORMULA (1-2)%. This is borne out by the numerical results obtained with
the complete contributions, which can be seen in the Tables.

CP-violating Asymmetries Involving FORMULA  Transitions
For FORMULA  transitions, we have
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , and again using CKM unitarity relation
FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
For the tree-dominated decays involving FORMULA  transitions, such as
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ,
the relation FORMULA  holds. This makes the formulae
simpler, yielding
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
with FORMULA .
The CP-violating asymmetry is now approximately given by
FORMULA 
with FORMULA .
Note, the CP-violating asymmetry is approximately proportional to
FORMULA  in this
case.
Here the suppression due to FORMULA  is accompanied with some
enhancement from
FORMULA  (the central value of this quantity is about 3
{{cite:4bcbe205-7f17-4148-91c2-9e8f885f0db9}}),
making the CP-violating asymmetry in this kind of decays to have a
value FORMULA -FORMULA .
We have calculated the CP-violating asymmetry of FORMULA  using the
approximate
formula (REF ). The number we got for FORMULA  is FORMULA ,
which is very close to the value FORMULA  in Table 11 calculated
using the exact formula, with FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .
For the decays with a vanishing tree contribution, such as
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , we have
FORMULA . Thus,
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
The CP-violating asymmetry is approximately proportional to FORMULA 
again,
FORMULA 
with FORMULA .
As the suppressions from
FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are not very big, the CP-violating asymmetry can again be
of order FORMULA -FORMULA . However, being direct CP-violating
asymmetries, the mentioned asymmetries in the specific FORMULA  modes depend on FORMULA  and are uncertain.

CP-violating Asymmetries in Neutral FORMULA  Decays
For the neutral FORMULA  decays, there is an additional
complication due to FORMULA  - FORMULA  mixing.
These CP-asymmetries may require time-dependent
measurements, as discussed in the literature
{{cite:07c92346-265d-4114-8338-8742386a6dd4}},?Citation `gr89' on page 1 undefined–?Citation `PW95' on page 1 undefined.
Defining the time-dependent asymmetries as
FORMULA 
there are four cases that one encounters for neutral FORMULA 
decays:

case (i): FORMULA , FORMULA , where FORMULA  or FORMULA 
is not a common final state
of FORMULA  and FORMULA , for example FORMULA .

case (ii): FORMULA  with
FORMULA , involving final
states which are CP eigenstates, i.e., decays such as FORMULA  etc.

case (iii): FORMULA  with
FORMULA , involving final states which are not CP eigenstates. They include
decays such as FORMULA , as the FORMULA  states are not CP-eigenstates.

case (iv): FORMULA  with FORMULA , i.e., both FORMULA  and FORMULA  are common
final states of FORMULA  and FORMULA , but they are not CP eigenstates.
Decays FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA  are two examples of interest for us.

Here case (i) is very similar to the charged FORMULA  decays. For case (ii),
and (iii), FORMULA  would involve FORMULA  - FORMULA  mixing.
Assuming FORMULA 
and FORMULA , which hold in the standard model for
the mass and width differences FORMULA  and
FORMULA  in the neutral FORMULA -sector, one can express
FORMULA  in a simplified form:
FORMULA 
The quantities FORMULA  and FORMULA , for which we follow the definitions given in
{{cite:0115c804-0f91-44ab-aa37-1c211bc64126}}, depend on
the hadronic matrix elements which we have calculated in our model.
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
For case (i) decays, the coefficient FORMULA  determines
FORMULA , and since no mixing is involved for these decays, the
CP-violating asymmetry is independent of time. We shall call these,
together with the
CP-asymmetries in charged FORMULA  decays, CP-class (i) decays.
For case (ii) and (iii),
one has to separate the FORMULA  and FORMULA 
terms to get the CP-violating asymmetry FORMULA .
The time-integrated asymmetries are:
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  for the FORMULA  - FORMULA 
case {{cite:94a73c8f-5511-4303-afc8-5901d8299bc2}}.
Case (iv) also involves mixing but requires additional formulae. Here one
studies the four
time-dependent decay widths for FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  {{cite:56c0c12f-490b-49f5-8fc9-b1c35c7c13ff}}, {{cite:e1b6adf2-a58c-4828-9f12-e484e4bcea1b}}, {{cite:0115c804-0f91-44ab-aa37-1c211bc64126}}.
These time-dependent widths can be expressed by four basic matrix elements
FORMULA 
which determine the decay matrix elements of FORMULA  and
of FORMULA  at FORMULA .
For example, when FORMULA  the matrix element FORMULA  is given in
appendix B of {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} in eq. (99) and FORMULA  for the decay FORMULA  is written down in eq. (100) in appendix B of {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.
The matrix elements FORMULA  and FORMULA  are obtained from FORMULA  and FORMULA  by
changing the signs of the weak phases contained in the products of the
CKM matrix elements. We also need to know the CP-violating parameter
coming from the FORMULA  - FORMULA  mixing. Defining:
FORMULA 
with FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
with FORMULA  representing the
FORMULA  and FORMULA  Hamiltonian {{cite:07c92346-265d-4114-8338-8742386a6dd4}}.
For the decays of FORMULA  and FORMULA , we use,
as before,
FORMULA 
So, FORMULA , and this ratio has only a phase given by FORMULA .
Then, the four time-dependent widths
are given by the following formulae (we follow the notation of {{cite:0115c804-0f91-44ab-aa37-1c211bc64126}}):
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
By measuring the time-dependent spectrum of the decay rates of FORMULA  and
FORMULA , one can find the coefficients of the two functions FORMULA 
and FORMULA  and extract the quantities FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  as well as
FORMULA  and FORMULA , which, however, are already well measured
{{cite:94a73c8f-5511-4303-afc8-5901d8299bc2}}. The signature of CP violation is
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  which means,
that FORMULA  and/or
FORMULA .
In the two examples, FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
the amplitudes FORMULA  and FORMULA  contain contributions of several terms similar
to what we have written down above for the charged FORMULA  decays. They have weak
and strong phases with the consequence that
FORMULA  and FORMULA .

Numerical Results for CP-Violating Coefficients and  FORMULA
Given the amplitudes FORMULA  and FORMULA , one can
calculate the CP-violating asymmetry FORMULA 
for all the FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  decay
modes and their charged conjugates whose branching ratios were calculated
by us recently in
the factorization approach {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}. The asymmetries
depend on several variables, such as the CKM parameters,
FORMULA , the virtuality FORMULA  discussed earlier, and the scale FORMULA .
The scale dependence of FORMULA  is important in only a few decays and we
shall estimate it by varying FORMULA  between FORMULA  and FORMULA 
at the end of this section for these decays and fix the scale at
FORMULA . The dependence on the
rest of the parameters is worked out explicitly. We show the results for
FORMULA , for two representative choices of the CKM parameters
in the tables:
TABLE 
TABLE 

Central values emerging from the CKM unitarity fits of the existing
data, yielding: FORMULA  {{cite:4bcbe205-7f17-4148-91c2-9e8f885f0db9}}.

For values of FORMULA  and FORMULA  which correspond to their
central values FORMULA , yielding FORMULA  and FORMULA .
{{cite:4bcbe205-7f17-4148-91c2-9e8f885f0db9}}.

For each decay mode and given a value of FORMULA , the errors shown on
the numbers in the tables reflect the uncertainties due to the variation of
FORMULA  in the range FORMULA  GeVFORMULA .
For some selected CP-asymmetries, we show
in figures, however, the dependence
on the CKM parameters for a wider range of FORMULA  and FORMULA  which
are allowed by the present FORMULA  C.L. unitarity fits {{cite:4bcbe205-7f17-4148-91c2-9e8f885f0db9}}.
TABLE 
TABLE 
The results are presented taking into account the following considerations.
For decays belonging to the CP class-(i), the CP-asymmetry is
time-independent.
Hence for this class, FORMULA . For the CP class-(ii)
and CP class-(iii) decays, the measurement of FORMULA  will be done in
terms of the coefficients FORMULA  and
FORMULA , which are the measures of direct and
indirect (or mixing-induced) CP-violation, respectively. In view of this,
we give in Tables REF  and REF  these coefficients for the
thirty decay modes of the FORMULA  and FORMULA  mesons, which belong
to these classes, for the two sets of CKM parameters given above.
For the four decays belonging to the CP class-(iv) decays, one would
measure by time-dependent decay rates the quantities FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA . They are given in
Tables REF  and REF  for the two sets of CKM parameters,
respectively. Having worked out these quantities, we then give the
numerical values of the CP-violating asymmetries for all the seventy six
decays FORMULA , FORMULA  transition), FORMULA  transition) and FORMULA 
in Tables REF  - REF .
TABLE 
TABLE 
TABLE 
TABLE 
Parametric Dependence of CP-violating Parameters and  FORMULA
We now discuss the CP-asymmetries given in Tables REF  - REF 
and their parametric dependence.

Form factor dependence of  FORMULA:
The CP-violating asymmetries depend very weakly on the form factors. We
have calculated the CP-violating asymmetries for the form factors based on
both the BSW {{cite:a68385f6-aeff-4c75-995b-a0e4acfd1ac7}} and the
hybrid Lattice-QCD/QCD-SR models. The form factor values
used are given in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.
However, the dependence of FORMULA  on the form
factors is weak. Hence, we show results only for the former case.

FORMULA -dependence of  FORMULA:
The classification of the FORMULA  decays using FORMULA -dependence of
the rates that we introduced in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} is also very useful in
discussing FORMULA .
We see that the CP-asymmetries in the class-I
and class-IV decays have mild dependence on FORMULA ,
reflecting very much the characteristics of the decay rates. As already
remarked, this
can be traced back to the FORMULA -dependence of the effective coefficients.
However, in some decays classified as class-IV decays in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}, we
have found that FORMULA  shows a marked FORMULA  dependence. All these cases
are on the borderline as far as the FORMULA -sensitivity of the decay rates is
concerned due to the presence of several competing amplitudes.
The decays, which were classified in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} as class-IV decays but
are now classified as class-V decays, are as follows:
TABLE 
TABLE 
FORMULA  decays: FORMULA .
FORMULA  decays involving FORMULA  transitions: FORMULA . (The decay mode FORMULA  was already
classified in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} as a class-V decay.)
FORMULA  decays: FORMULA .
With this, we note that the FORMULA -dependence of FORMULA  in
the class-I and class-IV decays is at most FORMULA , as one varies
FORMULA  in the range FORMULA  to FORMULA .
Concerning class-III decays, in most cases FORMULA  is
found to vary typically by a factor 2 as FORMULA  is varied, with one
exception: FORMULA , in which case the estimate for
FORMULA  is
uncertain by an order of magnitude. This is in line with the observation
made on the decay rate for this process in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.
Both CP-violating asymmetries and decay rates for the class-II and class-V
decays are
generally strongly FORMULA -dependent. We had shown this for the decay rates
in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} and for the CP-violating asymmetries this feature can be
seen in the
tables presented here.

FORMULA -dependence of  FORMULA:
The CP-violating asymmetries depend on the
value of FORMULA , as discussed in the literature {{cite:c70bb541-a22f-4bea-bf2b-67eb9d17297e}}. The value of FORMULA 
relative to the charm threshold, i.e., FORMULA ,
plays a central role here. For the choice FORMULA , the
FORMULA  loop will not generate a strong phase.
We treat FORMULA  as a variable parameter
and have studied the sensitivity of the CP-asymmetries by varying it in the
range FORMULA . This range may appear somewhat
arbitrary, however, it is large enough to test which
of the asymmetries are sensitive to the choice of FORMULA .
One sees from the tables, that FORMULA  as well as the CP-violating
parameters are sensitive to FORMULA  in most cases. Fortunately,
there are some decays which have large FORMULA  with only moderate
theoretical errors from the FORMULA -dependence.

FORMULA -dependence of  FORMULA:
It should be remarked that the CP-asymmetries depend on the renormalization
scale FORMULA . Part of this dependence is due to the fact that the strong
phases are generated only by the explicit FORMULA  corrections.
This can be seen in the numerator FORMULA  given in eq. (REF ). In
other words, NLO corrections to FORMULA , which are of of FORMULA 
remain to be
calculated. Despite this,
the scale-dependence of FORMULA  in FORMULA  decays is not very
marked, except for a few decays for which the relevant Wilson coefficients
do show some scale dependence. We give a list of these decays in Table 13.
This feature is quantitatively different from the scale-dependence of
FORMULA  in the inclusive radiative decays
FORMULA  and FORMULA  {{cite:430fffd7-8dfa-4162-8efa-2048f844b3d6}}, for which the
FORMULA -dependence of the Wilson coefficient in the electromagnetic penguin
operator introduces quite significant scale dependence in the
CP-asymmetries. In contrast, the Wilson
coefficients contributing to FORMULA  in the decays FORMULA  are less
FORMULA -dependent. Of course, there is still some residual scale dependence
in the quark masses. For all numbers and figures shown here, we use
FORMULA , a scale suggested by NLO corrections in the decay rates for
FORMULA  and FORMULA  {{cite:430fffd7-8dfa-4162-8efa-2048f844b3d6}}, for which NLO
corrections are small.

TABLE 

Decay Modes with Stable FORMULA  in the Factorization Approach
We use the parametric dependence of FORMULA  just discussed to pick out the
decay modes which are stable against the variation of FORMULA , FORMULA  and
the scale FORMULA .
As only class-I and class-IV (and some class III) decays are stable against
FORMULA , we need concentrate only on decays in these classes. With the help
of the entries in Tables 5-13, showing the FORMULA  and FORMULA  dependence, we
find that the following decay modes have measurably large asymmetries, i.e.,
FORMULA  (except for FORMULA  which is estimated
to be more
like FORMULA ) with
large branching ratios, typically FORMULA  (except for FORMULA , which is
estimated to be of FORMULA  {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}).

FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA .

We discuss these cases in detail showing the CKM-parametric
dependence of FORMULA  in each case. Since these decays measure, ideally,
one of the phases in the unitarity triangle, we shall also plot FORMULA 
as a function of the relevant phase, which is FORMULA 
for FORMULA , and FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and
FORMULA .

CP-violating asymmetry in  FORMULA
We show in Fig. REF (a) and REF (b) the CP-asymmetry parameters
FORMULA  and
FORMULA , defined in eq. (REF ) and (REF ),
respectively, plotted as a
function of the CKM-Wolfenstein parameter FORMULA  with the indicated values
of FORMULA .
The shadowed area in this and all subsequent figures
showing the FORMULA -dependence corresponds to the
range FORMULA , which is the FORMULA  allowed values of this
parameter from the unitarity fits {{cite:4bcbe205-7f17-4148-91c2-9e8f885f0db9}}.
The three curves in Fig. REF (a) and REF (b)
represent three different values of the
CKM-Wolfenstein parameter: FORMULA  (solid curve), FORMULA  (dashed
curve) and
FORMULA  (dotted curve).
The time-integrated asymmetry FORMULA  calculated with the help of
eq. (REF ) is shown for three values of FORMULA  (FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA )
with FORMULA  in Fig. REF (a).
One notes that the CKM-dependence of FORMULA  is very significant.
The FORMULA -dependence of FORMULA  is found to be very weak as
shown is
Fig. REF (b), where we plot this quantity as a function of FORMULA  for
FORMULA  by varying FORMULA  in the range FORMULA  GeVFORMULA .
Hence, there is a good case for FORMULA  yielding information
on the CKM parameters.
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
To have a closer look at this, we plot in Fig. REF (a) and
REF (b), the asymmetry FORMULA  as a function of
FORMULA  to study the effect of the penguin contribution
(called in the jargon “penguin pollution") and the dependence on
FORMULA , respectively. The lower (upper) curve in
Fig. REF (a)
corresponds to keeping only the tree contribution in the decays
FORMULA  (tree + penguin). We see that in the entire
FORMULA  expected range of FORMULA , depicted as a shadowed
region, the “penguin pollution" is quite significant, changing both
FORMULA  and its functional dependence on FORMULA .
Based on REF (b), we estimate FORMULA , with FORMULA  as an allowed solution,
varying FORMULA  in the FORMULA  range:
FORMULA  {{cite:4bcbe205-7f17-4148-91c2-9e8f885f0db9}}.

CP-violating asymmetry in  FORMULA
FIGURE 
The parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA 
for the decays
FORMULA  are shown in Fig. REF (a) and
REF (b), respectively, for FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA 
with fixed FORMULA . As can be seen from these figures,
the time-integrated CP-violating asymmetry FORMULA  is
completely dominated by the FORMULA  term. The
CP-violating asymmetry FORMULA  is shown in
Fig. REF (a) for three values of FORMULA  (FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ).
The upper curve for each value of FORMULA  is obtained by neglecting the tree
contribution in FORMULA  and the
lower curves represent the corresponding full (tree + penguin)
contribution.
Fig. REF (b) shows the FORMULA -dependence of FORMULA 
with the three (almost) overlapping curves corresponding to FORMULA  and
FORMULA  GeVFORMULA  for fixed value, FORMULA .
As we see from this set of figures, the CKM-parametric dependence of
FORMULA  is marked and the effect of the “tree shadow” is relatively
small. To illustrate this further, we plot in Figs. REF (a) and
REF (b) this asymmetry as a function of FORMULA , showing the
effect of the “tree-shadowing" and dependence of FORMULA 
on FORMULA , respectively. Restricting to the range FORMULA , which is the FORMULA  range for this quantity from the
unitarity fits {{cite:4bcbe205-7f17-4148-91c2-9e8f885f0db9}}, we find
that FORMULA  has a value in the range
FORMULA .
This decay has been measured by the CLEO Collaboration with a branching ratio
FORMULA  and is well accounted for in the factorization-based approach
?Citation `akl98-1' on page 1 undefined–?Citation `acgk' on page 1 undefined.
As the “tree shadow' is small in the decay FORMULA 
and the electroweak penguin contribution is also small {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}},
FORMULA  is a good measure of FORMULA . This was
anticipated by London and Soni {{cite:76e20d7c-7611-48e1-957c-243be199892b}}, who also advocated FORMULA  as a measure of the angle FORMULA , following the earlier
suggestion of the same in
ref. {{cite:83c14f3e-d7eb-45c3-96c2-ccb5bce50ff7}}. The CP-asymmetry for this decay, like FORMULA , is
dominated by the FORMULA  term.
The quantity FORMULA  is found to
be stable against variation in FORMULA  and FORMULA  (see Tables 9 and 10). However,
being a class-V decay, the branching ratio for FORMULA 
(and its charged
conjugate) is very sensitively dependent on FORMULA , with FORMULA , with the lower (higher) range corresponding to
FORMULA 
(FORMULA  {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}. Moreover, the electroweak penguin effect in this
decay is
estimated to be rather substantial. The present upper bound on this decay is
FORMULA  {{cite:52ee9ff5-3ab7-484a-9d30-522f4ce406a6}}.
Depending on FORMULA ,
the above experimental bound is between one and two orders of magnitude away
from the expected rate.
Despite the large and stable value of FORMULA , it may turn out
not to be measurable in the first generation of B factory experiments.

The decay FORMULA  is dominated by the penguins, with significant
electroweak penguin contribution {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.
The estimated decay rate in the factorization approach is FORMULA , with the present experimental
bound
being FORMULA  {{cite:8597515b-b661-4de5-9c3e-603fdced89b5}}, with

We expect that with FORMULA  FORMULA  events, several hundred FORMULA 
decays will be measured. The CP-asymmetry FORMULA  is dominated by
the FORMULA  term (see Tables 1 and 2), which is
large, stable
against variation in FORMULA  and shows only a mild dependence on FORMULA .
The quantities FORMULA  and FORMULA 
for this decay
(together with the others in the FORMULA  and FORMULA 
decays)
were worked out by Kramer and Palmer in {{cite:c70bb541-a22f-4bea-bf2b-67eb9d17297e}}. As remarked already,
there are detailed
differences in the underlying theoretical framework used here and in {{cite:c70bb541-a22f-4bea-bf2b-67eb9d17297e}}
and also in the values of the CKM and other input parameters, but using
identical values of the various input parameters for the sake of comparison,
the agreement
between the two is fair.
We show in Fig. REF (a), FORMULA 
as a function of FORMULA  for three values of FORMULA :
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and note that this dependence is quite marked.
The FORMULA -dependence of FORMULA  is found to be small,
as shown in Fig. REF (b). Thus, we expect that FORMULA  is
also a good measure of FORMULA . This is shown in Fig. REF ,
with the three
curves showing the additional dependence of FORMULA 
on FORMULA . Restricting the value of FORMULA  in the FORMULA  range shown by the shadowed region, we find
FORMULA .

The decay FORMULA , like the preceding decay, is dominated by
the penguins with significant electroweak penguin contribution {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.
The branching ratio for this mode is estimated to be about a factor 3 too
small compared to
FORMULA , with FORMULA .
The CP-violating asymmetry FORMULA  is, however, found to be
very similar
to FORMULA .
This is shown in Fig. REF (a) where we plot FORMULA  as a

FORMULA  fixed.
The FORMULA -dependence of FORMULA  is shown in Fig. REF (b)
and is found to be moderately small in the range FORMULA  GeVFORMULA .
We show in Fig. REF  FORMULA  as a function of FORMULA , with the
three curves showing three different values of FORMULA .
Restricting again

As the CKM-parametric dependence of the CP-violating asymmetries FORMULA ,

As the branching ratio for the decay FORMULA  is estimated
to be
small, typically FORMULA ,
the above estimates of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  hold also to a
very good approximation if we now also include FORMULA  in FORMULA .
The dependence of FORMULA  on the CKM parameters FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is shown in Fig. REF (a) and the FORMULA -dependence in
Fig. REF (b). Interestingly, the FORMULA -dependence in various components
which is already small gets almost canceled in the sum, yielding
FORMULA  which is practically independent of FORMULA . We show the
dependence of FORMULA  on FORMULA  in Fig. REF ,

CP-violating asymmetry in  FORMULA
As another example of the decay whose FORMULA  is stable against variation
in FORMULA  and FORMULA , we remark that the decay mode FORMULA  is
estimated to have an asymmetry FORMULA , as can be seen in
Table 11 and 12.
This decay mode is dominated by the tree amplitudes (like FORMULA )
and belongs to the CP class (iii) decays.
Estimated branching ratio for this mode is FORMULA .


The Decays FORMULA , FORMULA  and
CP-Violating
Asymmetries
Next, we discuss decay modes which belong to the CP class (iv) decays.
There are four of them FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA . Of these the decay
FORMULA  belongs to the Class-V decay and is estimated to
have a very small branching ratio in the factorization approach
FORMULA  {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.
The other FORMULA  is a Class-IV decay but is expected
to have also a small branching ratio, with FORMULA .
In view of this, we concentrate on the decays FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
FIGURE 
With FORMULA  and FORMULA , the time evolution of the
four
branching ratios is given in eq. (REF ). They have each three
components with
characteristic time-dependences proportional to FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
with the relative and overall normalization explicitly stated there.
The time dependence of the branching ratio FORMULA  and of the branching ratio for the charge conjugate decay
FORMULA 
is shown in Fig. REF (a) and REF (b), respectively.
The time dependence of the branching ratio FORMULA 
and of FORMULA 
is shown in Fig. REF (a) and REF (b), respectively.
The three components and the sum are depicted by the four curves.
FIGURE 
The resulting time-dependent CP-violating asymmetry FORMULA  for
FORMULA  defined as
FORMULA 
is shown in Fig. REF  through the solid curve.
The corresponding asymmetry FORMULA  defined in an
analogous way as for FORMULA  is given by the dashed curve
in this figure.
FIGURE 
We recall that the decay rate for FORMULA  averaged over its
charge conjugated decay FORMULA  is estimated to have
a value in the range FORMULA -FORMULA  {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}; the time-integrated CP-asymmetry is estimated to be
FORMULA -FORMULA .
Being a Class-I decay, both the branching ratio FORMULA  and FORMULA  are FORMULA -stable.
In addition, FORMULA  is also FORMULA -stable, as shown in
Table 7.
The branching ratio for the decay FORMULA , averaged over
its charge conjugate decay FORMULA , is expected to be
FORMULA -FORMULA 
{{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}, i.e.,
typically a factor 4 smaller than FORMULA .
Also, FORMULA  is estimated somewhat smaller for the central
value of the CKM-parameter FORMULA , FORMULA .
For these CKM parameter, we estimate FORMULA -FORMULA .
For FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  (see Table 8).
We note that our estimate of the ratio FORMULA  derived in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} is
in reasonable agreement with the corresponding ratio estimated in {{cite:e1b6adf2-a58c-4828-9f12-e484e4bcea1b}}
but we also find FORMULA , which is drastically different from the estimates presented in
{{cite:e1b6adf2-a58c-4828-9f12-e484e4bcea1b}}.

Decay Modes with Measurable but FORMULA -dependent  FORMULA
In addition to the decay modes discussed above,
the following decay modes have FORMULA  which are FORMULA - and
FORMULA - stable but show significant or strong FORMULA -dependence.
However, we think that further theoretical work and/or measurements of
FORMULA  in one or more of the following decay modes will greatly help in
determining FORMULA  and hence in reducing the present theoretical dispersion
on FORMULA .

These decays have branching ratios which are estimated to be several multiples
of FORMULA  to several multiples of FORMULA  and may have FORMULA  at
least of FORMULA , but being uncertain due to the FORMULA -dependence may reach
rather large values. The CP-violating asymmetries in these cases belong to the
class (i), i.e., they are direct CP-violating asymmetries.
In Fig. REF (a) and REF (b), we show the CP-violating asymmetry
FORMULA  as a function of FORMULA .
The three curves in Fig. REF (a) correspond to the three choices of
FORMULA ,
with FORMULA , whereas the three curves in Fig. REF (b) correspond
to using FORMULA  GeVFORMULA  (dotted curve), FORMULA  (dashed-dotted
curve), FORMULA  GeVFORMULA  (dashed curve) with FORMULA .
Depending on the value of FORMULA , FORMULA  could reach a
value FORMULA .
The branching ratio is estimated to lie in the range FORMULA .
The decay mode FORMULA  has very similar CKM and
FORMULA -dependence, which is shown in Fig. REF (a) and (b), respectively,
where we plot the CP-asymmetry FORMULA .
Also, the branching ratio FORMULA  estimated in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} is
very similar to FORMULA .
FIGURE 
In Fig. REF (a) and REF (b),
we show the CP-violating asymmetry FORMULA 
in the decays FORMULA .
This is a Class-III decay dominated by the tree amplitude and is expected
to have a branching ratio FORMULA , where an average over the
charge conjugated decays is implied.
However, depending on the value of FORMULA  this decay mode may show a large
CP-violating asymmetry, reaching FORMULA 
for FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  GeVFORMULA .
For FORMULA  GeVFORMULA , the CP-asymmetry comes down to a value
FORMULA .
All of these values are significantly higher than the ones reported in
{{cite:8f3795a4-a55d-42af-ab18-6f79506a0dc3}}.
Large but FORMULA -sensitive values of this quantity have also been reported
earlier in {{cite:c70bb541-a22f-4bea-bf2b-67eb9d17297e}}.
We also mention here the decay modes FORMULA , whose branching
ratio is estimated as FORMULA  {{cite:90079d3d-644b-4f92-aa8c-9473ac396045}}, {{cite:4c45ea92-5d74-42df-95cb-2256d314b4ab}}, {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} and which may have CP-violating asymmetry
in the
range FORMULA -FORMULA  depending on the CKM
parameters and FORMULA  (see Tables 9 and 10).
FIGURE 
Finally, we mention two more decay modes FORMULA  and
FORMULA  which are both Class-IV decays, with branching ratios
estimated as FORMULA  and FORMULA  {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}. The CP-violating asymmetries in these decays are
estimated
to lie in the range FORMULA -FORMULA .
In Fig. REF (a) and REF (b), we show FORMULA 
as a function of FORMULA  by varying FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively.

Summary and Conclusions
Using the NLO perturbative framework and a generalized factorization
approach discussed in detail in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}, we have calculated the
CP-violating asymmetries
in partial decay rates of all the two-body non-leptonic decays FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the light pseudoscalar and vector
mesons. Our results can be summarized as follows:

We find that the decay classification scheme presented in
{{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} for the branching ratios is also very useful in
discussing the CP-violating asymmetries. In line with this, Class-I and
class-IV
decays yield asymmetries which are stable against the variation of FORMULA .
There are two exceptions, FORMULA  and
FORMULA , which vary by a factor 3 and 1.65, respectively,
for FORMULA .

Estimates of CP-violating asymmetries in Class-II and class-V
decays depend rather sensitively on FORMULA  and hence are very
unreliable. There is one notable exception FORMULA , which is
parametrically stable and large. However being a class-V decay, the
branching ratio FORMULA  is uncertain in the
factorization approach by at least an order of magnitude {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.

The CP-asymmetries in Class-III decays vary by approximately a
factor 2, as one varies FORMULA  in the range FORMULA , with
the exception of FORMULA  and FORMULA 
which are much more uncertain. The FORMULA -sensitivity of FORMULA  was already pointed out in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}}.

The CP-violating asymmetries worked out here are in most cases
relatively insensitive to the scale FORMULA , i.e., this dependence is below
FORMULA ,
for FORMULA ,
except in some decays which we have listed in Table 13.

As opposed to the branching ratios, asymmetries do not depend in the
first approximation on the form factors and decay constants. However,
in most cases, they depend on the parameter FORMULA , the virtuality of the
FORMULA  and FORMULA  decaying into FORMULA  from the penguin
contributions. This has been already studied in great detail in {{cite:c70bb541-a22f-4bea-bf2b-67eb9d17297e}},
a behavior which we have also confirmed.

Interestingly, we find that a number of FORMULA  decays
have CP-violating asymmetries which can be predicted within a reasonable
range in the factorization approach. They include:
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The decay modes involved have reasonably large branching ratios and the
CP-violating asymmetries are also measurably large in all these cases.
Hence,
their measurements can be used to put
constraints on the CKM parameters FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Likewise, these decay modes are well suited to test the hypothesis
that strong phases in these decays are generated dominantly by
perturbative QCD. This, in our opinion, is difficult to test
in class-II and class-V decays.
Of particular interest
is FORMULA , which is expected to have a value
FORMULA -FORMULA . This decay mode has already
been measured by the CLEO collaboration {{cite:8597515b-b661-4de5-9c3e-603fdced89b5}} and estimates of
its branching ratio in the factorization approach are in agreement with
data ?Citation `akl98-1' on page 1 undefined–?Citation `acgk' on page 1 undefined.

The CP-asymmetry FORMULA , where FORMULA  is found to be remarkably stable in FORMULA , due to the
compensation in the various channels. The resulting CP-asymmetry is found
to be large, with FORMULA -FORMULA , with the range
reflecting the CKM-parametric dependence.

We have studied the dependence of FORMULA  on FORMULA , studying
the effect of the “penguin pollution”, which we find to be significant.
The effect
of the “tree-shadowing” in FORMULA  is, however,
found to be
small. Thus, FORMULA , likewise FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are good measures of FORMULA .

We have studied time-dependent CP-violating asymmetries FORMULA 
and FORMULA , working out the various characteristic
components in the time evolution of the individual branching ratios. With the
branching ratio averaged over the charge-conjugated modes FORMULA  and time-integrated CP-violating asymmetry FORMULA , for the central values FORMULA  and FORMULA , it is an
interesting process
to measure, as stressed in {{cite:e1b6adf2-a58c-4828-9f12-e484e4bcea1b}}. The branching ratio FORMULA  is estimated by us as typically a factor 4 below FORMULA  and hence FORMULA  is a relatively more difficult
measurement.

There are several class-IV decays whose CP-asymmetries are small
but stable against variation in FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA . They include:
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .
CP-asymmetries well over FORMULA  in these decay modes can arise through
SFI and/or new physics. We argue that
the role of SFI can be disentangled already in decay rates
and through the measurements of a number of CP-violating asymmetries which
are predicted to be large. As at this stage it is hard to quantify the
effects of SFI, one can not stress too strongly that a measurement of
CP-violating asymmetry in any of these partial rates significantly above
the estimates presented here will be a sign of new physics.

There are quite a few other decay modes which have measurably large
CP-violating asymmetries, though without constraining the
parameter FORMULA  experimentally, or removing this dependence in an improved
theoretical framework,
they are at present rather uncertain. A good measurement of
the CP-asymmetry in any one of these could be used to determine FORMULA .
We list these potentially interesting asymmetries below:
FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA .

In conclusion, by systematically studying the FORMULA  decays
in the factorization approach, we hope
that we have found classes of decays where the factorization approach can be
tested as it makes predictions within a reasonable range. If the predictions
in the rates
in these decays are borne out by data, then it will strengthen the notion
based on
color transparency that non-factorization effects in decay rates are small
and QCD dynamics in
FORMULA  decays can be largely described in terms of perturbative
QCD and factorized amplitudes. This will bring in a number of CP-violating
asymmetries under quantitative control of the factorization-based theory.
If these expectations did not stand the experimental tests, attempts to
quantitatively study two-body
non-leptonic decays would have to wait for a fundamental step in the QCD
technology
enabling a direct computation of the four-quark matrix elements in the decays
FORMULA . However, present data on FORMULA  decays are
rather encouraging and perhaps factorization approach is well poised
to becoming a useful theoretical tool in studying non-leptonic FORMULA  decays -
at least in class-I and class-IV decays.
We look forward to new experimental results where many of the predictions
presented here and in {{cite:99ad300d-a0c5-49e1-ba84-535094c66d40}} will be tested in terms of branching
ratios and CP-violating asymmetries in partial decay rates.
