We seek to quantify non-normality of the most amplified resolvent modes and predict their features based on the characteristics of the base or mean velocity profile. A 2-by-2 model linear Navier-Stokes (LNS) operator illustrates how non-normality from mean shear distributes perturbation energy in different velocity components of the forcing and response modes. The inverse of their inner product, which is unity for a purely normal mechanism, is proposed as a measure to quantify non-normality. When the operator is normal but not self-adjoint, a phase difference between the forcing and response modes is indicated. In flows where there is downstream spatial dependence of the base/mean, mean flow advection separates the spatial support of forcing and response modes which impacts the inner product and leads to non-normal amplification. Success of mean flow (linear) stability analysis for a particular frequency depends on the normality of amplification. If the amplification is normal, the resolvent operator can be rewritten in its dyadic representation to reveal that the adjoint and forward stability modes are proportional to the forcing and response resolvent modes at that frequency. If the amplification is non-normal, then resolvent analysis is required to understand the origin of observed flow structures. Eigenspectra and pseudospectra are used to characterize these phenomena. Two test cases are studied: low Reynolds number cylinder flow and turbulent channel flow. The first deals mainly with normal mechanisms hence the success of both classical and mean stability analysis with respect to predicting the critical Reynolds number and global frequency of the saturated flow. Quantification of non-normality using the inverse inner product of the leading forcing and response modes agrees well with the product of the resolvent norm and distance between the imaginary axis and least stable eigenvalue. An approximate wavemaker computed from the resolvent modes scales with the length of the mean recirculation bubble. In the case of turbulent channel flow, structures result from both normal and non-normal mechanisms, suggesting that both are necessary elements to sustain turbulence. Mean shear is exploited most efficiently by stationary disturbances while bounds on the pseudospectra illustrate how non-normality is responsible for the most amplified disturbances at spatial wavenumbers and temporal frequencies corresponding to well-known turbulent structures. Some implications for flow control are discussed.
Introduction
Background
Decomposing unsteady and turbulent flows into low-rank models is an important step towards the realization of closed-loop flow control, which has proven to be elusive (at least in part) due to the high degrees of freedom in most flow systems. Despite the inherent complexity, a time-averaged flow, or mean, that is statistically stationary can often be defined and leveraged using the eigenvalue spectrum of the governing Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) to educe the frequencies, i.e. the imaginary part of the eigenvalues, and shapes of coherent structures which appear in the flow. Recent studies have demonstrated the success of mean flow stability analysis for a variety of flows including thermosolutal convection {{cite:0b77f95f-8c77-409a-a2ae-fc3f37e31145}}, turbulent jets {{cite:67180a94-4b9d-434b-a106-909161e06055}}, {{cite:2292f36f-9fc3-4e27-a34c-9b360dcdb736}}, {{cite:21d161bf-d408-4db2-9378-906468b13f74}}, and flow over a backward facing step {{cite:49608752-73b7-4bc7-9011-071cf47b0965}}. There is also a significant body of work discussing stability analysis of the mean cylinder wake which was shown by {{cite:469b3a58-ee81-4b95-a6b1-f185adc1c676}} to correctly identify the frequency of the globally unstable flow above the critical Reynolds number of FORMULA  {{cite:ef936f27-8ab4-4d3d-a88a-3febb794cff3}}, {{cite:835d33b5-b785-44ce-8e64-71af6c012bc4}}, {{cite:051d7b9a-5b74-4097-9bd3-85b1d69d1a21}}. Notably, classical linear stability analysis of the base flow, which is an equilibrium solution of the NSE, at supercritical Reynolds numbers does not predict the correct observed frequency. The base (laminar) and mean (time-average of the fluctuating velocity field) profiles are differentiated because of the importance of nonlinearity in sustaining the latter.
Recent work has endeavored to explain why and when mean stability analysis is valid. {{cite:469b3a58-ee81-4b95-a6b1-f185adc1c676}} suggested that success corresponds to cases where the Reynolds stresses are unperturbed at order FORMULA  when considering infinitesimal perturbations FORMULA  to the mean flow solution. This was confirmed by {{cite:75178660-43bd-481d-8564-ba2767cd3bd5}} who performed a weakly nonlinear expansion of the cylinder base flow near criticality and determined that the nonlinear interaction of the leading global mode with its conjugate, i.e. the contribution to the mean Reynolds stresses, significantly outweighed the interaction of the mode with itself leading to additional harmonics of the wavenumber. {{cite:99427934-857c-42fd-924d-b73f330b1fd2}} provided a self-consistent framework for the cylinder mean flow by approximating the divergence of the Reynolds stresses with the leading global mode and its conjugate.
 {{cite:75178660-43bd-481d-8564-ba2767cd3bd5}} used open cavity flow as a counter example to the validity of mean stability analysis where the predicted frequencies do not match direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the flow. This discrepancy can be attributed to the non-normality of the flow which leads to non-orthogonality of the global modes and sensitivity of the spectrum to perturbation of the operator {{cite:16a1831e-9217-4777-beed-ff618658cadd}}. In such circumstances, the behavior of the system can be more accurately characterized by consideration of the properties of the pseudospectrum of the LNS operator using resolvent analysis ,  rather than the spectrum itself. {{cite:9ae0ef13-0675-45b7-83d4-2086bfe3d2c6}} formulated the linearized problem for laminar channel flow in input-output terms, where the resolvent operator constitutes the transfer function between them, considering the component-wise transfer from harmonic exogenous disturbance or forcing (input) to velocity response (output). There is also a broad literature considering stochastic forcing, {{cite:6a789d4c-3c8a-4b16-a1f0-686f4e6a20aa}}, and the initial condition, transient growth problem, {{cite:d1ba675c-6dea-441d-8266-973033ca9ae7}}.
{{cite:6efd3bc5-41f0-4184-8286-db67bba78a69}} and {{cite:0ef37e43-bc2c-4bc2-a5e4-3ae442d93b73}} considered the resolvent reformulated with respect to the turbulent mean flow for canonical turbulent wall flows. The latter authors employed an eddy viscosity to account for the action of the Reynolds stresses, while the former analysis extends the approach to include the nonlinear terms as the input forcing to the linear operator, i.e. closing the feedback loop. {{cite:6efd3bc5-41f0-4184-8286-db67bba78a69}} performed a singular value decomposition of the resolvent to identify the inputs giving rise to the most amplified responses which are ranked by their gain (singular value). The approach has been extended to non-parallel flows  {{cite:b158ec3b-c4d9-4233-8260-b532cf856f7a}}, , {{cite:aa034086-9dec-4303-90be-9873c6b9b3f2}}, {{cite:f7c565fd-11b6-42da-815b-4535bd3fff52}}. {{cite:49608752-73b7-4bc7-9011-071cf47b0965}} concluded that mean stability analysis was valid when the dominant singular value of the resolvent operator was significantly greater than the others at a given frequency and that this condition holds for flows where there is a dominant convective instability mechanism and an eigenvalue which is nearly marginally stable. In such circumstances, it was shown that the eigenmodes are proportional to the resolvent response modes.

Motivation and scope of the study
A broad review of the approaches discussed above can be found in {{cite:d948b12b-9e98-4a04-9076-b89abfdedee9}}. Given the lack of a comprehensive understanding of when spectral and pseudospectral analyses lead to perturbations with characteristics that are observed in real flows, and when the base or mean flow will lead to success, our approach is to synthesize the characteristics of the LNS operator with a view to answering specific questions.
One of the main objectives of this paper is to understand the conditions under which eigenanalyses and resolvent analyses yield the same results, i.e. when spectral and pseudospectral analyses reveal the same most amplified perturbations. Furthermore, we seek to address when each method is likely to lead to successful prediction of flow features, and whether the properties of the base or mean flow (which are inputs to form the linear operators for both eigen- and resolvent analyses) indicate when these analyses coincide. This leads to deeper questions about the resolvent operator and the types of amplification mechanisms it admits.
It is well known that the response of a system to harmonic input (forcing) can occur due to normal and/or non-normal mechanisms. The former corresponds to excitation in the vicinity of an eigenvalue (with exponential growth if the eigenvalue is unstable) while the latter is due to nonmodal effects associated with the sensitivity of the spectrum to perturbation. Subsequent to the work of {{cite:9ae0ef13-0675-45b7-83d4-2086bfe3d2c6}}, {{cite:ab9ac25c-814b-4e70-9aed-c7d20adebfc6}} and {{cite:61d6c699-78ef-4617-99db-b331224c12f4}} investigated the distribution of energy and relative phase between velocity components in analyses about laminar, base flows in recirculation bubbles and the flat plate boundary layer, respectively. These studies distinguished between component-type non-normalities which distribute energy in different velocity components and convective non-normalities, which separate the spatial support of forcing upstream of the response. The roots of these non-normalities are the mean shear and mean flow advection terms, respectively, in the linearized NSE. These terms also result in the Orr mechanism {{cite:733ba247-e4b3-4eb5-9d0b-89e415a65b7c}} which reorients upstream-leaning forcing modes with the mean shear such that the response modes are leaning downstream {{cite:0301c1e4-21ef-4229-8119-bbdccd34c532}}. In this paper we extend the analysis to include turbulent mean flows and quantify non-normality based on inner products between the resolvent forcing and response modes. The special case of limited spatial overlap of the forcing and response modes, which is known as a wavemaker {{cite:01fb315f-ced1-4bd4-9596-7db1e8177dff}} and arises when there is sufficiently strong reverse flow {{cite:0e680fe8-994c-4c82-8194-c2df8621fc59}}, is also addressed.
Non-normality can be investigated through the lens of the pseudospectrum of the LNS operator. Most previous studies have only investigated the pseudospectra of parallel base flows {{cite:16a1831e-9217-4777-beed-ff618658cadd}}, {{cite:89824b52-2a48-4df1-8a06-300cc9ccb4a0}}, {{cite:e6345ea6-6281-41fb-94a4-617b775f3c69}}, {{cite:dca6c2cd-f175-4edf-b4ed-c385c7904eac}}, {{cite:6ac7f63c-e7a2-43d5-8a19-3f12b97f394d}}, {{cite:ad07c796-8832-44b8-b912-b8408935b19b}}. In this study, pseudospectral analysis is extended to mean flows with or without spatial development. The contribution from normality of the operator, or resonance, can be quantified from the spectrum alone by computing the inverse distance between the imaginary axis and the nearest eigenvalue. The contribution from non-normality of the operator can be quantified by bounds of the pseudospectrum which may be dramatically different from the spectrum if the operator is non-normal and thus sensitive to perturbations. For complex flows where a variety of frequencies and wavenumbers are active, both normal and non-normal mechanisms may be simultaneously present and dynamically important.
Lastly, we consider the conditions under which the resolvent operator can be considered to be low-rank. Here we use the term low-rank to describe an operator whose behavior can be well approximated by a low-rank operator as opposed to the meaning that the operator is of low numerical rank. {{cite:6efd3bc5-41f0-4184-8286-db67bba78a69}} identified low-rank characteristics of the resolvent for turbulent wall flows via the rapid decrease of singular value with increasing order of the singular value decomposition. They attributed this to the dominance of specific physical mechanisms that are efficiently captured through representation in terms of spatio-temporal modes. Subsequent work {{cite:775ba034-3ff2-46f3-b9f5-34f297c8b6e9}}, {{cite:49608752-73b7-4bc7-9011-071cf47b0965}} has exploited the low-rank approximation of the resolvent to construct reduced-order models of complex flows. We show that the question of rank of the resolvent at a particular frequency can be investigated by analyzing the pseudospectrum as well as the ratio of the largest to smallest terms in the resolvent operator itself.

Choice of flows and outline of the paper
We consider low Reynolds number cylinder flow and turbulent channel flow to demonstrate the contributions of this paper. Flow around a circular cylinder is an example of an oscillator flow {{cite:78b5a555-2f1b-4a5c-9176-cb5bb9288c6e}} which has intrinsic dynamics that are insensitive to background noise. The flow exhibits a region of absolute instability {{cite:0e680fe8-994c-4c82-8194-c2df8621fc59}}, {{cite:bd96780b-5d02-4ca7-956a-30d8962c9d16}} which can be approximated using the wavemaker {{cite:aea48712-e6d6-48da-88bf-410632cc5941}}. Using resolvent analysis and plotting bounds of the pseudospectrum for a given perturbation magnitude, it is evident that resonance accounts for the bulk of the amplification. The impact of mean flow advection, however, which separates the spatial support of the forcing and response modes, introduces convective non-normality and leads to a resolvent norm which is appreciably larger than the contribution from resonance alone. In the case of turbulent channel flow, which is a noise-amplifier {{cite:78b5a555-2f1b-4a5c-9176-cb5bb9288c6e}}, the choice of temporal frequency and spatial wavenumbers has an impact on the influence of non-normality. We analyze several structures which are either highly amplified or representative of known turbulent structures in order to establish the role of normal and non-normal mechanisms as well as generalize when low-rank behavior can be expected.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section , the governing equations are derived for the linear operators which form the basis of stability and resolvent analysis. In Section , the resolvent operator is rewritten to differentiate normal and non-normal amplification mechanisms. A model LNS operator and its resolvent without spatial dependence is used to isolate the effects of individual terms in the NSE on the forcing and response modes. The effect of spatial dependence is discussed particularly under the influence of mean shear and reverse flow. Finally, the resolvent operator is rewritten using its dyadic representation to formally relate stability and resolvent modes and show when the rank-1 approximation is appropriate for normal mechanisms. Application of the findings to circular cylinder flow is considered in Section ; the numerical methods are outlined and resolvent analysis is applied to both base and mean flows. The results are compared to those from a stability analysis. Section  studies the observations from earlier sections in the context of turbulent channel flow. The influence of the wall-normal height and spatial and temporal wavenumbers are shown to play a major factor in the type of amplification mechanisms which dominate as well as whether or not the resolvent is low-rank. Conclusions are presented in Section  along with the implications for reduced-order modeling and control.

Governing Equations
The relevant operators for the analyses that follow are derived from the incompressible NSE which are non-dimensionalized by the characteristic length and velocity scales, FORMULA  and FORMULA :


t u + u u = -p + Re-1 2
u
u = 0.



The states FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the spatially- and temporally-varying velocity and pressure fields, respectively (explicit statement of the spatial and temporal dependences will be dropped hereon for conciseness), while FORMULA  is the Reynolds number based on FORMULA  and FORMULA . After Reynolds-decomposing the states into a stationary temporal mean (denoted by an overline) and a fluctuating component (denoted by a prime), one obtains the mean flow equations:


u u + p - Re-1 2 u = - u' u'
u = 0.
 

For an exact solution of the NSE, i.e. a true base flow, the divergence of the Reynolds stress tensor, or the right-hand term in Equation , is zero. Henceforth we identify the temporal mean in such a case by FORMULA . If the term is nonzero, however, FORMULA  does not constitute an exact solution and the action of Reynolds stresses must be taken into account to satisfy the NSE. We will refer to FORMULA  in this case as a (turbulent) mean flow.
Subtracting the mean momentum equations (Equation ) from the NSE (Equation ) yields the following for the fluctuating quantities:


t u' + u u' + u' u + p' -Re-1 2 u' = -u' u' + u' u' = f'
u' = 0.



Equation  has been written such that all linear terms appear on the left-hand side. The nonlinear terms on the right-hand side can be lumped together as a forcing FORMULA  without loss of generality. The literature devoted to analyzing these linearized equations is broad and covers a range of flows. We recap here the analyses required for the subsequent development and refer the reader to recent reviews and contributions {{cite:52e834df-a9a3-40bc-9896-b36d90bda788}}, {{cite:6ac7f63c-e7a2-43d5-8a19-3f12b97f394d}}, {{cite:e287a464-23b0-42a7-a7e2-5ab77bd9ca6c}}, {{cite:ad07c796-8832-44b8-b912-b8408935b19b}}, {{cite:e2129237-c747-4283-aa9c-00314304a365}} for further information.
Our development considers global and spatially periodic modes in the context of bluff body and wall-bounded turbulent flows, respectively. The conclusions, nevertheless, are applicable when using the parabolized stability equations (PSE), , although PSE is appropriate only for the treatment of convective instability and not absolute instability {{cite:6b6467ff-bc86-4029-8fba-e22c335ba2e2}}. They are also applicable to both base and mean flows although there are important differences between the results for these profiles which will be drawn out. The temporal mean velocity profiles are known throughout the domain from numerical simulation for the cylinder flow while they are obtained via an eddy viscosity model {{cite:6bdd1ca5-4a49-437d-ae10-26ff5c9da369}} for the turbulent channel flow. We begin by considering the general case in which there exists invariance only in time. In other words, the analysis is performed in the frequency domain, such that mode shapes may be functions of all three spatial dimensions. Decomposition into spatial wavenumbers is applied in the case of wall-bounded turbulent flows with streamwise and spanwise periodicity in Section .
Eigenmode decomposition
The classical (temporal) linear stability analysis, detailed, for example, in {{cite:dca6c2cd-f175-4edf-b4ed-c385c7904eac}}, proceeds under the assumption of small perturbations to the steady state. It has been performed relative to both base and mean flows in order to determine frequencies subject to exponential growth (instability). See e.g. {{cite:d948b12b-9e98-4a04-9076-b89abfdedee9}} for further details. Substituting perturbations of the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , into Equation  yields at FORMULA :


u  = -u u - u u - p + Re-1 2 u
u  = 0,
 

where a tilde will be used to denote that a stability analysis has been performed. Written explicitly for base flows in operator form, one obtains
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the LNS operator with respect to the base flow,
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Similarly, we use FORMULA  to denote the LNS operator with respect to the mean flow, such that for mean flow stability analysis
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
The resulting eigenvalue problems for base and mean flows are summarized in the upper row of Table REF . Stability analysis is based on the spectrum of the LNS operator and FORMULA  is an indicator of the linear stability of a given profile. The eigenvectors may be used as a basis for modal decomposition.
TABLE 
The adjoint NSE have been derived by, e.g. {{cite:99551cde-a9e1-4c97-a0d4-694fc04dd6f7}}, and the linearized operators can be written for both base and mean flows, FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively, for the adjoint variables FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
The operators satisfy
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the scalar product associated with the energy in the whole domain.
For a general operator, FORMULA , that is normal, i.e. FORMULA , the eigenvectors of FORMULA  corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal although the eigenvalues may be complex. Self-adjoint operators FORMULA , on the other hand, have orthogonal eigenvectors and real eigenvalues. In general, the LNS operators FORMULA  and FORMULA  are neither self-adjoint nor normal. These phenomena account for the differences between Equations REF , REF  and Equations REF ,  and their influence is discussed in Section .

Resolvent analysis
For the more general case when the perturbation cannot be considered to be infinitesimal and the nonlinearity FORMULA  is retained, Equation  can be rewritten in terms of a transfer function between the forcing (input) and response state (output) {{cite:dca6c2cd-f175-4edf-b4ed-c385c7904eac}}, {{cite:9ae0ef13-0675-45b7-83d4-2086bfe3d2c6}}, {{cite:6efd3bc5-41f0-4184-8286-db67bba78a69}}. This transfer function is the (linear) resolvent operator, which can be defined around either the base or mean flow (see Table REF ). Endogenous nonlinear terms in Equation  when FORMULA  is not required to be small or exogenous forcing can be treated equally well via FORMULA , although the interpretation of the resulting system is different.
For harmonic forcing and response at temporal frequency FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
and a base flow profile, FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
where the caret denotes that the perturbation is associated with a resolvent analysis. The resolvent operator is given by
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
Similarly, for a mean flow,
FORMULA 
It should be noted that the sense of the imaginary and real parts of FORMULA  is reversed in the resolvent analysis relative to the definition customary to the stability literature of Equation REF : here the real part of FORMULA  is the frequency associated with a mode while the imaginary part is set to zero as only neutral disturbances are considered. In stability analysis, the imaginary part of FORMULA  is the frequency of the disturbance and the real part is the growth rate.
FORMULA  can be decomposed via a singular value decomposition (SVD), e.g. {{cite:6efd3bc5-41f0-4184-8286-db67bba78a69}}:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the left and right singular vectors corresponding to the response and forcing modes, often called resolvent modes {{cite:6efd3bc5-41f0-4184-8286-db67bba78a69}}, respectively. Both sets of singular vectors are guaranteed to be orthonormal bases and are ranked according to their gain, or singular value, contained in the diagonal matrix FORMULA . The resolvent operator can thus be written as the sum of outer products of the left and right singular vectors
FORMULA 
FORMULA  is (approximately) low rank if
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  is small {{cite:04b50cd6-6aa3-4795-9b2a-2ef9f987db74}}, {{cite:e2129237-c747-4283-aa9c-00314304a365}} . If the leading singular value is significantly greater than all others (FORMULA ) then the rank-1 approximation can be invoked and the resolvent is approximated by the outer product of the leading optimal response and forcing modes:
FORMULA 
The physical interpretation of the resolvent response modes is the response to forcing that results in a neutrally stable response, i.e. with the real component of frequency equal to zero. The singular value gives the input-output gain, here associated with the energy norm.

Spectrum and pseudospectrum of the LNS operator
Analyzing the resolvent corresponds to considering the spectrum of the perturbed LNS operator:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the pseudospectrum of FORMULA  under a perturbation magnitude FORMULA  and FORMULA  is the (operator) 2-norm {{cite:16a1831e-9217-4777-beed-ff618658cadd}}, {{cite:89824b52-2a48-4df1-8a06-300cc9ccb4a0}}, {{cite:d948b12b-9e98-4a04-9076-b89abfdedee9}}. An equivalent definition is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the spectrum of FORMULA . Throughout the paper, we will use FORMULA  to represent the set of eigenvalues and FORMULA  the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. If FORMULA  is normal, FORMULA  can be interpreted as the set of points away from FORMULA  by only less than or equal to FORMULA  on the complex plane {{cite:d948b12b-9e98-4a04-9076-b89abfdedee9}}. If FORMULA  is non-normal, this distance may be greater than FORMULA  signifying that an eigenvalue is sensitive to perturbation of the LNS operator.
For a given FORMULA , the resolvent norm FORMULA  is equal to the largest value of FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is contained within FORMULA . The resolvent norm is (by definition) the maximum singular value of the resolvent operator, and quantifies the system's sensitivity to temporal forcing.
The neutrally stable response of the system to harmonic forcing is characterized by the value of the resolvent norm along the imaginary axis. For a stable, normal operator, the largest response occurs at the frequency corresponding to the imaginary part of the least stable eigenvalue FORMULA  and the resolvent norm is FORMULA  since FORMULA  is the minimum distance between the eigenvalue and the imaginary axis {{cite:52e834df-a9a3-40bc-9896-b36d90bda788}}. If the operator is marginally stable FORMULA , then FORMULA  and the response is dominated by the corresponding eigenmode. For a stable, non-normal operator, the frequency and gain of the largest response is less predictable since it is necessary to find the smallest value of FORMULA  for which the pseudospectrum crosses the imaginary axis.
Having reviewed the derivations and interpretations of the two analyses that will be considered here, we now elaborate on the mathematical and physical origins of the associated amplification mechanisms and componentwise transfer. Simple example operators are used to illustrate the concepts, in the spirit of {{cite:8762094e-1905-40d7-81c8-dd9e9b660de7}}, before we consider the complete LNS operator.

Mechanisms for amplification
Resonance and pseudoresonance
The origin of the amplification mechanisms characterized by the resolvent norm can be identified by expanding the resolvent through an eigenvalue decomposition of the LNS operator,
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  represents the matrix of eigenvectors of the LNS operator for either the base or mean flow profile and FORMULA  the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. These can be used to find an upper and lower bound for the resolvent norm :
FORMULA 
Considering first the far-righthand term in Equation REF , it is clear that forcing in the vicinity of an eigenvalue, i.e. FORMULA , is likely to lead to amplification due to resonance. This is a normal phenomenon, predictable from an eigenanalysis. Large amplification also arises in the event of pseudoresonance when the condition number FORMULA  is large due to non-orthogonality of the eigenvectors, a consequence of the non-normal nature of FORMULA  and hence FORMULA . In the formulation of Equation REF , the resolvent therefore contains both the amplification mechanisms associated with the eigenvalue spectrum accessed via eigenanalysis (normal mode linear stability analysis) and the non-normal amplification that is possible when the eigenvectors are not orthogonal to each other. In what follows, we will identify “optimal pseudoresonance" as the condition under which the amplification in Equation REF  is associated with pseudoresonance, i.e. FORMULA , to be compared with the resonant case in which FORMULA .
FIGURE 
To demonstrate the amplification characteristics of the resolvent for normal and non-normal operators, we sketch in Figure REF  the pseudospectra for simple example operators,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a normal operator containing only the eigenvalues of the non-normal operator FORMULA . Level curves of FORMULA  for operators FORMULA  and FORMULA  satisfy
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
respectively.
For a normal operator such as FORMULA , FORMULA  and the level curves of FORMULA  are proportional to the distance from the closest eigenvalue. The resolvent norm for a particular FORMULA  is inversely proportional to the distance from FORMULA  to the nearest eigenvalue. The spectrum and pseudospectra of FORMULA  are shown in Figure REF (a); there are two stable eigenvalues denoted by red crosses, and the pseudospectra consist of circular contours centered on the two eigenvalues. Since both eigenvalues are significantly damped, amplification due to resonance is not possible and the magnitude of the resolvent norm is less than one (Figure REF (b)). Moreover, the eigenvalue and singular value decompositions of FORMULA  yield parallel basis functions, and the singular values are simply the magnitude of the eigenvalues.
Operator FORMULA , however, is non-normal due to the non-zero off-diagonal term and, with reference to Equation REF , FORMULA . The shifts of the eigenvalues of the perturbed operator are not proportional to FORMULA , as indicated by the pseudospectrum isocontours in Figure REF (c), and the resolvent norm of Figure REF (d) is appreciably larger than that of the normal case in Figure REF (a), with values exceeding one. Furthermore, the maximum value of the resolvent norm occurs at a non-resonant frequency, FORMULA . Amplification is possible for a linearly stable operator due to pseudoresonance under forcing at any frequency for which FORMULA . It is important to add that even when the primary contribution to amplification is a normal mechanism, non-normality can still contribute to exacerbate the response. For example, the amplification at the frequencies of the eigenvalues in Figure REF  is higher for operator FORMULA  than it is for the purely normal operator FORMULA . That being the case, the right-hand side of Equation REF  may be large due to one or both terms in the product.

Eigenvectors, singular functions, and non-normality of the operator
We specialize now to operators with similar behavior to the LNS system and consider the associated features of eigenvector and singular value decompositions. We choose a model operator with characteristics similar to the LNS, in the vein of that explored by {{cite:8762094e-1905-40d7-81c8-dd9e9b660de7}} but without specifying numerical values. The LNS for the two-dimensional velocity field associated with a one-dimensional base or mean flow variation takes a similar form to FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
By selecting a one-dimensional operator, we have elected to neglect spatial (streamwise and spanwise) dependence of the base flow and therefore the modes themselves here. Nevertheless, the impact of the various types of term in the LNS operator on the resolvent modes can be modeled. Here FORMULA  is analogous to the stabilizing role of viscosity through the FORMULA  term and FORMULA  represents mean flow advection through the FORMULA  term. FORMULA  is real and is analogous to mean shear FORMULA , which here is equal to the gradient in the 2-direction of mean flow in the 1-direction. Thus in this simple 2-by-2 example, FORMULA  models the lift-up mechanism {{cite:091ed507-b6a0-4534-a029-a2cd5bc553a9}} by coupling forcing in the FORMULA -direction (second component of the vector) with a response in the FORMULA -direction (first component of the vector).
The resolvent of FORMULA  is:
FORMULA 
In order to isolate the effect of non-normality introduced via the off-diagonal term in Equation REF , the eigenvalues are assumed to be real and we limit the immediate development to stationary disturbances (FORMULA ) to eliminate the remaining imaginary terms, such that
FORMULA 
For the limiting case of FORMULA , i.e. zero mean shear, FORMULA  and its resolvent are self-adjoint and therefore normal. If the least stable eigenvalue has real part close to zero which would occur, say, if FORMULA , the singular value decomposition can be simplified to
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , i.e. the resolvent is low-rank. Thus the response can be well predicted from the leading singular vectors FORMULA  and FORMULA . For a normal operator, these are identical to each other, FORMULA , and identical to the corresponding eigenvectors. The inner product FORMULA  quantifies the componentwise correspondence between the forcing and response modes which, in this limit, is equal to unity. A schematic of the variation in the FORMULA  and FORMULA  directions of the forcing and response mode, i.e. the singular vectors, in this case is shown in Figure REF (a-b).
The optimal pseudoresonance case occurs in the limit FORMULA , for which:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA . The constants FORMULA  and FORMULA  are real and positive. The resolvent operator is still low-rank in this limit, but FORMULA  and FORMULA  are now orthogonal to each other and thus the inner product FORMULA . The perturbation energy in the optimal forcing mode is concentrated in the second component of the vector while the perturbation energy in the optimal response mode is concentrated in the first component, as sketched in Figure REF (c-d).
The analogous eigenvalue decomposition of (non-normal) FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a positive, real constant. Unlike the resolvent response modes which are orthogonal to one another, the eigenvectors are non-orthogonal, such that FORMULA . Thus, in this case the stability and resolvent modes are different. Since the eigenvectors are nearly parallel, they both project equally well onto the optimal resolvent response mode. The same can be said for the projection of the adjoint modes, which are also nearly parallel, onto the optimal resolvent forcing mode. The optimal response and forcing modes, therefore, are linear combinations of multiple stability and adjoint modes, respectively. Furthermore, it is not clear from this decomposition that the resolvent operator is low-rank.
As outlined in Figure REF , the model operator given in Equation REF  can be used to elucidate that the presence of mean shear, which introduces non-normality into the LNS operator, is to concentrate energy in different velocity components of the resolvent forcing and response modes. The model LNS operator does not need a base or mean flow with any special characteristics or spatial dependence other than an off-diagonal term to reveal this. Nevertheless, the same mechanism will be present in the case of more complex variation of shear, as is common in real flows. In the normal limit where there is no mean shear, the forcing and response are in the same velocity component. In the pseudoresonant limit, the forcing acts in the FORMULA  direction while the response is in the FORMULA  direction.

Eigenvectors, singular functions, and self-adjointness of the operator
In this section, we isolate the effect (or lack thereof) of self-adjointness on the characteristics of the resolvent modes. To this end, the mean shear term is set to zero, i.e. FORMULA  in Equation REF , guaranteeing that the LNS and resolvent operators are normal:
FORMULA 
Again we will limit the discussion to stationary disturbances FORMULA  as the presence of FORMULA  in the resolvent operator will always guarantee that it is not self-adjoint.
If the eigenvalues are real, FORMULA  and FORMULA  are self-adjoint and the SVD of the resolvent is
FORMULA 
Equation REF  is similar to the normal limit case of Equation REF  and illustrates that the resolvent forcing and response modes are identical.
The simplest way to demonstrate what happens when the resolvent is not self-adjoint is to assume that the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. In this case, the SVD of the resolvent is
FORMULA 
Since the singular values of the resolvent are required to be real yet the eigenvalues are imaginary, the resolvent response modes must be FORMULA  out of phase from the resolvent forcing modes as is portrayed in Figure REF .

Mean flow advection and the Orr mechanism
In the case of an operator that is not self-adjoint and has non-zero mean shear, i.e. FORMULA , the spatio-temporal manifestation of the Orr mechanism is observed. This mechanism results in disturbance amplification by the reorientation of an input tilted against the mean shear into a response which is aligned with the mean shear, with the maximum amplification in the transient case occurring when the disturbance is vertical.
In the continuously forced formulation of the present problem, the Orr mechanism is attributable to the space dependence of FORMULA  in the mean flow advection term. Assuming a parallel flow FORMULA  with non-zero mean shear FORMULA  and traveling at the local mean velocity for a given FORMULA , the flow above FORMULA  moves towards the downstream direction while the flow below moves upstream in a relative sense. There is, therefore, a phase difference of FORMULA  across FORMULA  which manifests itself in the response modes {{cite:e2129237-c747-4283-aa9c-00314304a365}}. The decrease in phase results in the response modes leaning downstream, aligned with the mean shear. When considering the adjoint LNS operator FORMULA , the mean flow advection acts in the upstream direction due to the sign change of FORMULA . The corresponding phase jump across FORMULA  is now in the opposite sense and this results in the forcing modes leaning upstream. Artificially removing mean flow advection from the resolvent operator suppresses the Orr mechanism. Figure REF  is a cartoon illustrating how the Orr mechanism results in the tilting of the resolvent forcing and response modes.

Resolvent (approximate) wavemaker
For a spatially-varying base or mean flow, further statements can be made concerning the effect of the non-self-adjoint nature of the resolvent operator on the resolvent mode shapes, namely a difference in the spatial support of forcing and response modes, with the latter being downstream of the former. For a spatially-developing base or mean flow, normal mechanisms can be categorized in terms of either convective or absolute instability depending on the characteristics of the profile. The non-self-adjoint nature of FORMULA  changes the influence of the convective terms in the adjoint operator, per Equations REF  and , or, for the model operator of Equation REF ,
FORMULA 
The direction of mean flow advection is reversed since the adjoint of the derivative operator introduces a negative sign implying that adjoint perturbations are transported upstream. Direct or forward perturbations, on the other hand, are transported downstream. For absolutely unstable flows, for which perturbations grow both upstream and downstream of the source, the advection term may no longer separate the spatial support of the forcing/adjoint and response/forward modes leading to regions of overlap at resonant frequencies. This region, known as the wavemaker, is traditionally computed from the eigenmodes, and is associated with non-zero values of FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  denotes a position in space {{cite:aea48712-e6d6-48da-88bf-410632cc5941}}.
In cases where amplification is due to normal mechanisms, the resolvent modes can be used to find the wavemaker as long as they are normalized appropriately. The wavemaker approximates regions of the flow which are absolutely unstable or self-sustaining since perturbations are prevented from convecting due to reverse flow {{cite:886f4311-09ae-4d41-a7b7-7eee78aeacb3}}. {{cite:0e680fe8-994c-4c82-8194-c2df8621fc59}} have shown that when a mean profile of hyperbolic tangent form exhibits greater than 13.6% reverse flow with respect to the free stream, the flow is absolutely unstable. The streamwise extent of absolute instability and the wavemaker is finite since flow reversal is confined to a certain portion of the flow. This information is encoded within the advection term FORMULA  through the sign of FORMULA . We note that the overlap of the resolvent forcing and response modes was identified as a qualitative proxy for sensitivity for base flows by {{cite:61d6c699-78ef-4617-99db-b331224c12f4}}. Henceforth we will denote the wavemaker of Equation REF  as the “true” wavemaker and the approximation using resolvent modes as the “resolvent” wavemaker. If the flow is convectively unstable, there is no region of reverse flow and so FORMULA  is always positive. In this case, the optimal response or stability mode will be downstream of the optimal forcing or adjoint mode. The inner product FORMULA  decreases when the modes are separated in space. {{cite:52e834df-a9a3-40bc-9896-b36d90bda788}} noted that this is due to the convective-type non-normality introduced from advection of the base flow.
The cartoon in Figure REF  summarizes the relative positioning of the various modes for a 2D normal operator. The top row is characteristic of a convective-type instability where mean flow advection orients the optimal forcing upstream of a downstream, detached response. The bottom row represents a case where there is overlap between the forcing and response modes indicating a resolvent wavemaker where the flow exhibits an absolute-type instability. The implications of this approximate wavemaker region are discussed in the context of cylinder flow in Section .

Low-rank approximation of the resolvent through a dyad expansion
We present what is believed to be a novel (if logical) expansion of the above analysis to demonstrate and formalize the conditions under which analysis of the resolvent is likely to identify stability modes as the most amplified disturbance. We also highlight when the rank-1 approximation is appropriate for amplifications which are normal in character.
As is more customary for the eigenvalue problem {{cite:99551cde-a9e1-4c97-a0d4-694fc04dd6f7}}, {{cite:ad07c796-8832-44b8-b912-b8408935b19b}} a dyad expansion of the resolvent FORMULA  for a generic, non-singular linear operator FORMULA  can be performed,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are the FORMULA th left and right eigenvectors of FORMULA , respectively. Since the objective of resolvent analysis is often the identification of the most amplified neutral disturbance, FORMULA  is substituted for FORMULA  and the eigenvectors of the LNS operator for FORMULA  and FORMULA  into Equation REF  to give
FORMULA 
Thus if the real part of an eigenvalue FORMULA  is sufficiently close to zero and the forcing frequency FORMULA  is identical to the imaginary part, then its contribution to the series dominates over the contributions from all other eigenvalues. The resolvent, furthermore, can be approximated by the forward and adjoint eigenvectors corresponding to that frequency weighted by the inverse distance between the eigenvalue and the imaginary axis:
FORMULA 
Equation REF  represents a rank-1 approximation of the resolvent operator using eigenvectors. In the context of base flows, the resolvent is singular at the critical Reynolds number since the real part of the least stable eigenvalue is identically zero when it crosses the imaginary axis. In the case of mean flows, which tend to be marginally stable {{cite:6bdd1ca5-4a49-437d-ae10-26ff5c9da369}}, {{cite:469b3a58-ee81-4b95-a6b1-f185adc1c676}}, {{cite:0b77f95f-8c77-409a-a2ae-fc3f37e31145}}, Equation REF  is applicable for eigenvalues near the imaginary axis. It is important to note that an eigenvalue does not have to be marginally stable, but it must be the dominant contribution to the series in Equation REF . It is possible to obtain a rank-1 approximation of the resolvent even when an eigenvalue is highly damped as will be seen in Section .
This rank-1 approximation fails when there is not sufficient separation of eigenvalues at the frequency of interest (see Appendix  for an example). If there are several eigenvalues in the vicinity of the imaginary axis at a frequency FORMULA , then the resolvent operator can no longer be approximated by just one outer product in Equation REF . Equating the two low-rank approximations of the resolvent operator in terms of eigenvectors (Equation REF ) and resolvent modes (Equation REF ) implies the following:
FORMULA 
since
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a complex constant. The leading resolvent response and forcing modes are proportional to the forward and adjoint eigenmodes, respectively, and this holds for any base or mean flow as long as only one eigenvalue leads to amplification. The similarity between the resolvent forcing and adjoint stability modes draws out how the resolvent operator contains sensitivity information, as described by, {{cite:6d344295-1261-485e-9dfa-4fe830e3dca6}}. The development is less amenable to non-normal mechanisms where the proximity of an eigenvalue to the imaginary axis does not necessarily govern the behavior of the resolvent (see, e.g. Figure REF ). Some guidelines for when a rank-1 approximation is expected to work for a general resolvent operator are presented in Section .

The relationship between spectral radius and spectral norm for approximately low-rank operators
For a nonsingular linear operator FORMULA , we now seek to find an explicit relationship between the spectrum of FORMULA  and the spectral norm of its resolvent FORMULA . We are particularly interested in cases where FORMULA  is approximately low-rank (i.e., a small number of leading singular values are much larger than the others).
The spectral radius FORMULA  of an operator FORMULA  can be defined through the eigendecomposition  FORMULA
FORMULA 
The spectral radius of the corresponding resolvent operator is
FORMULA 
Note that, with this definition, Equation REF  may be expressed as
FORMULA 
For non-normal operators with large condition numbers, the upper and lower bounds span a large range, and thus do not give much insight into the size of the resolvent norm, FORMULA .
To estimate the resolvent norm in terms of the spectral radius, we will make use of the relationship {{cite:1849ffcf-1846-4218-ae5a-5e79ca6621c0}}
FORMULA 
Suppose now that the largest singular value of resolvent operator (for a given FORMULA ) is much larger than the rest, such that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is FORMULA  with all but the first singular value set to zero.
Suppose in addition that this truncation is also accurate for powers of FORMULA , i.e., that we have
FORMULA 
Defining the quantity
FORMULA 
we then have

(* 1)n 
= 1n(1*1)n
 r11  0   0
r21  0   0
FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA .

We may now estimate the norm of powers of the resolvent as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA , and we have used the fact that FORMULA  is unitary.
Consequently, assuming that Equation REF  holds, Equation REF  results in the estimate
FORMULA 
In other words, we may estimate that the resolvent norm is larger than the lower bound in Equation REF  by a factor of FORMULA . This analysis relied on the rather restrictive assumption that only the leading singular value was large. If there is a pair of large singular values, as is often the case in channel flows (owing to spatial symmetry across the mid-plane of the channel) then we may generalize the argument as follows. Suppose that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are of comparable size, and that all other singular values are negligibly small. If we further assume that FORMULA , then we find that

(* )n  11*1  2 1*2  0   0
12*1  22*2  0   0
FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA n
1n |1*1|n-1
 r11  0   0
r21  0   0
FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  +
2n |2*2|n-1
 0  r12  0   0
0  r22  0   0
FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA  FORMULA ,

which, following the same approach as before, gives
FORMULA 
Thus the inverse of FORMULA  can be interpreted as the contribution of non-normality to the resolvent norm. We can also identify the product FORMULA  as a quantification of non-normality since FORMULA  represents the resonance contribution to the resolvent norm. However, since highly amplified modes may occur at non-resonant frequencies, the contribution from FORMULA  is typically overestimated as it is likely for a pseudoeigenvalue to reside much closer to the imaginary axis than the nearest eigenvalue of the unperturbed spectrum. As will be seen in Sections  and , these two predictions tend to agree in cases where amplification can be attributed to a single eigenvalue and mean stability analysis is valid.
Having examined the implications of the structure of the operator on amplification and forcing and response modes, we now consider two real example flows. Low Reynolds number cylinder flow is used to investigate the choice of base or mean flow as the linear stability threshold is crossed (Section ). A canonical wall turbulence configuration is employed to identify the influence of the various terms in the resolvent on the resulting SVD (Section ).

Application to cylinder flow
We apply a global resolvent analysis to the base and mean velocity profiles for cylinder flows under the critical Reynolds number FORMULA  {{cite:ef936f27-8ab4-4d3d-a88a-3febb794cff3}}, {{cite:835d33b5-b785-44ce-8e64-71af6c012bc4}}, {{cite:051d7b9a-5b74-4097-9bd3-85b1d69d1a21}}, as well as mean flows of the 2D laminar vortex shedding regime where FORMULA  {{cite:5fcc1df4-3d94-46b1-ba97-cac386cf9f3a}}. Cylinder flow is a particularly suitable choice to investigate trends associated with the wavemaker since it exhibits a region of absolute instability.
Numerical methods
The relevant procedures for computing the two-dimensional base and mean flows, FORMULA  and FORMULA , are detailed here before applying the analysis tools.
The NSE (Equation ) are non-dimensionalized by the cylinder diameter FORMULA  and inlet velocity FORMULA  which are both set to unity. For the base flow calculation, a uniform inlet velocity condition is prescribed while no-slip Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied to the cylinder surface, symmetric conditions to the upper and lower boundaries, and advective conditions to the outlet. The nonlinear equations for FORMULA  are solved using a Newton method on a finite-element mesh generated by FreeFem++ (see {{cite:91fa953e-5882-4e53-904b-740d5d2571c5}}). Taylor-Hood finite elements (P1b, P1b, P1 for FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA  respectively) are used for spatial discretizations. The computational domain FORMULA  spans FORMULA  with the cylinder centered at the origin and the mesh is made up of 104,214 triangles resulting in 365,358 degrees of freedom for velocity and pressure.
A DNS of the cylinder flow is also performed to obtain the mean flow profile using FreeFem++ with the same boundary conditions and mesh. A second-order semi-implicit time discretization is employed with a non-dimensional time step FORMULA . Beyond FORMULA , the simulated flow settles into regular vortex shedding at a fixed amplitude FORMULA  and temporal frequency FORMULA  where the subscript FORMULA  denotes shedding. The mean flow FORMULA  is computed by time-averaging the DNS state vector over 25 complete shedding cycles. The linear operators are formed in FreeFem++ and the only boundary condition which differs with respect to the base flow calculation is at the inlet where homogeneous boundary conditions are enforced so that the perturbations vanish at infinity. The eigenvalues are computed using a shift-and-invert strategy, the details of which are discussed in {{cite:97277f78-c4eb-4af9-b21a-6ca77917d18e}}. The generalized eigenvalue problem is then solved with the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi method using the ARPACK library developed by {{cite:cb60a7b1-1850-4283-9088-010e3cde652b}}.
The singular values of the resolvent operator are computed in a manner outlined by {{cite:6aa65a9b-a3b8-4004-9df2-2be5d1392585}}; a brief summary of the procedure is presented here. The singular value problem is reformulated as the following eigenvalue problem:
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the FORMULA th right singular vector corresponding to the singular value FORMULA  of FORMULA . The largest eigenvalues of the Hermitian operator FORMULA  are computed using the ARPACK library and the parallel MUMPS solver developed by {{cite:2e69e39d-1d78-4459-a6f1-6d3a4c84ec2f}}. The response modes are then computed from Equation REF .

Base flow velocity profile
A resolvent analysis is performed on the cylinder base flow for various Reynolds numbers over a range of FORMULA . Contours of the pseudospectrum for FORMULA  are overlaid onto the spectrum, which is in agreement with {{cite:75178660-43bd-481d-8564-ba2767cd3bd5}} to within the sensitivity to the mesh geometry, in Figure REF (a). The variation of the resolvent norm along the imaginary axis, i.e. FORMULA , is plotted alongside the second singular value of the resolvent, FORMULA , and the inverse of the distance between the nearest eigenvalue and the imaginary axis in Figure REF (b). There is only one frequency FORMULA  of interest, where the first singular value is several orders of magnitude larger than all the others (only two are shown for clarity). For the cylinder base flow at FORMULA , FORMULA  corresponds to the true FORMULA  at the onset of vortex shedding. The amplification is significantly lower for all other frequencies, including harmonics, and FORMULA  is very close to the imaginary part of the least stable eigenvalue. In short, resolvent analysis of the base flow yields useful predictions for the frequency of the unsteady flow in the vicinity of the bifurcation like its stability counterpart.
FIGURE 
The previous observations reinforce why stability analysis about the base flow can predict FORMULA . Only one structure at the globally most amplified frequency is prone to significant amplification at subcritical Reynolds numbers and it is the first to become unstable. This is characteristic of an absolute instability mechanism in which frequency selection is not influenced by background noise. The stability modes and resolvent modes are nearly identical as seen in Figure REF .
FIGURE 
The effect of lift-up is weak since the energy is fairly evenly distributed in the FORMULA  and FORMULA components of both the forcing and response modes in Figure REF . Mean flow advection, on the other hand, plays a significant role in the spatial support of the forcing and response modes which are located upstream and downstream of the cylinder. {{cite:52e834df-a9a3-40bc-9896-b36d90bda788}} made an analogous observation for the forward and adjoint eigenmodes and attributed this to convective non-normality. Since the resolvent operator is low-rank, computing FORMULA  is a good estimate of the non-normal amplification experienced by the flow. We obtain a value of FORMULA  which is in good agreement with FORMULA  (see Table REF ) in Figure REF (b). There is also a physical overlap of the forcing and response modes in the region where the flow is absolutely unstable, which can be attributed to the extent of reverse flow.
The least stable global mode and its adjoint counterpart are computed for various Reynolds numbers near and below FORMULA  to illustrate the cylinder transition from convective to absolute instability. Figure REF  juxtaposes the FORMULA -component of the adjoint mode, forward mode, and wavemaker. The forward mode has unit magnitude while the adjoint has been normalized with respect to the forward mode such that their inner product is unity. A wavemaker first appears for FORMULA , the Reynolds number at which {{cite:bd96780b-5d02-4ca7-956a-30d8962c9d16}} determined the cylinder wake is absolutely unstable. There is no wavemaker for lower Reynolds numbers due to the downstream location of the forward eigenmode which is a consequence of mean flow advection; the strength of the reverse flow is not sufficient to produce an overlap region. For the lowest two Reynolds numbers considered in Figure REF , the contour levels of the forward eigenmode immediately behind the cylinder are three orders of magnitude smaller than their higher Reynolds number counterparts. The downstream location where the contour levels are significant does not appear within the plotted domain. As the Reynolds number increases, the velocity deficit grows and the reverse flow directly behind the cylinder strengthens. The forward eigenmode gradually appears closer to the cylinder until there is a nontrivial overlap between it and its adjoint counterpart.
FIGURE 
Beyond the critical Reynolds number, the region of the flow which is absolutely unstable is sufficiently long for the flow to become globally unstable. Perturbations grow exponentially in time until they are saturated by nonlinearities. The resulting velocity fluctuations are dominated by the vortex shedding. Once the flow has reached a limit cycle, the shedding frequency is different from that predicted by resolvent analysis of the base flow since the frequency of the least stable perturbations is altered during the saturation process. Additionally, the mean recirculation region behind the cylinder is shorter than its base flow counterpart in the streamwise direction.

Mean velocity profile
The focus of resolvent analysis typically shifts when using the mean velocity profile rather than the base flow. The goal becomes identification of the energetically important structures and their frequencies in the unsteady flow rather than prediction of the external forcing and structure which appears when the flow becomes unsteady.
Contours of the pseudospectrum corresponding to the mean flow in the 2D laminar shedding regime are overlaid with the spectrum of the mean flow at FORMULA  in Figure REF . The resolvent norm along the imaginary axis is also plotted alongside the second largest singular value. Similar to the base flow resolvent, there is only one frequency at which there is a resonant peak.
FIGURE 
Unlike the base flow case, the most amplified frequency at supercritical Reynolds numbers correctly predicts the shedding frequency as seen in Figure REF . While the resolvent norm always peaks at a distinct frequency for all cases, the growth rate of the least stable eigenvalue of the base flow continues to grow while the frequency remains roughly constant. Figure REF  shows that the largest peak occurs at the stability limit, FORMULA . The maximum amplification, which here is proportional to the inverse distance between the eigenvalue and the imaginary axis, indicates the progression of the least stable pole across the complex plane and over the imaginary axis. The resolvent norm has not been plotted for supercritical base flows since the resolvent attempts to quantify the size of perturbation necessary for the spectrum to cross the neutral axis. For the base flow at the critical Reynolds number FORMULA  and mean flows where FORMULA , the size of this perturbation is very small leading to very highly amplified disturbances.
FIGURE 
The peak resolvent norm for the mean flows has no discernible pattern in Figure REF  since the real part of the eigenvalue is approximately zero. It is very sensitive, therefore, to the spatial resolution and temporal convergence of the mean flow in addition to the discretization of FORMULA . Nevertheless, proportionality between the resolvent and stability mode shapes can be expected. Substituting FORMULA  for FORMULA  into Equation REF , since the real part of the marginally stable mode is nearly zero, yields
FORMULA 
The sum in Equation REF  is dominated by the contribution from the marginally stable mode so the resolvent operator can be approximated by the outer product of the marginally stable mode and its adjoint counterpart or the optimal resolvent response and forcing modes at FORMULA . Similar to the base flow case, we can quantify FORMULA  and this agrees fairly well with the ratio of FORMULA  (see Table REF ).
Rather than comparing the stability and resolvent mode shapes as shown in Figure REF , the true and approximated wavemakers associated with the mean flow, computed using stability and resolvent modes, respectively, are compared for FORMULA  in Figure REF (a,b). The stability wavemaker is in good agreement with the one computed by {{cite:3fd1b366-59a2-46fe-b24a-4f08d2a67e24}}. A very close match between the extent of the two wavemaker regions can be observed, implying that the underlying modes are indeed proportional to each other. Streamlines from the mean flow are superimposed to observe how the wavemaker is related to the mean recirculation bubble, the size of which depends on Reynolds number. The length of the recirculation bubble scales with the streamwise extent of the wavemaker region for any Reynolds number for either the mean flow as seen in Figure REF (a,b) or base flow as seen in Figure REF (c,d). The advection term in the operator FORMULA  changes sign in the reverse flow region behind the cylinder which then guarantees overlap between the adjoint and forward eigenvectors, per Section REF .
FIGURE 
The true (stability) wavemaker regions associated with the base profile are shown in Figures REF (c) and (d) for FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively. Figures REF (a) and (d) compare the mean and base wavemakers at FORMULA . The main difference between base and mean flows is that as the Reynolds number increases, both the mean recirculation bubble {{cite:77cd8b21-abb7-4354-9b69-01a3d457cad7}} and wavemaker region shrink, whereas for the unstable base flows, increasing the Reynolds number will also increase the streamwise length of the recirculation bubble and wavemaker region (Figures REF (c)-(d)). Therefore, the wavemaker computed from the mean flow is a better indication of the region of instability in the flow as it is responsible for the selection of the nonlinear frequency and amplitude of the limit cycle.

Resolvent modeling of (low Reynolds number) cylinder flow
In the case of flow around a circular cylinder, the resolvent identifies only stability mechanisms for both the base and mean flow cases. There are no frequencies at which amplification occurs due to pseudoresonance. This is consistent with the work of {{cite:b9561aeb-d8bf-459e-b3d9-86ef78427103}} who investigated direct transient growth analysis to study its role in the primary and secondary bifurcations of cylinder flow. Since only one mode becomes unstable, the effect of the nonlinearities is to saturate the growth mechanism and this alters the frequency of the structure {{cite:469b3a58-ee81-4b95-a6b1-f185adc1c676}}. While the base flow is unable to predict the nonlinear frequency in the saturated state, it can be correctly predicted from the mean flow. Thus in the case of stability mechanisms leading to unsteadiness (e.g. cylinder flow, Rayleigh-Bénard convection {{cite:0b77f95f-8c77-409a-a2ae-fc3f37e31145}}), mean stability analysis is successful at predicting the frequency of the unsteady flow.

Application to wall turbulence
We now consider turbulent channel flow in the context of the discussion from Section . Unlike the cylinder flow, which is an oscillator with intrinsic dynamics that are insensitive to background noise, this flow is an example of a noise-amplifier; as such, pseudoresonance plays a big role and leads to significant amplification at non-resonant frequencies. Due to its geometric simplicity, we choose channel flow at FORMULA  which has a parallel mean velocity profile FORMULA .
Numerical Methods
We again consider the non-dimensional, incompressible NSE where the channel half-height FORMULA  and the friction velocity FORMULA  (where FORMULA  is the wall shear stress, FORMULA  is the density) are the characteristic scales to obtain


t u + u u = -p + Re-1 2 u

u = 0,


where FORMULA  and FORMULA  is the kinematic viscosity. The streamwise direction and spanwise directions are periodic, and the wall-normal domain extends from FORMULA  to FORMULA  with no-slip and no-penetration conditions imposed at the wall. The velocity field is Reynolds decomposed into the sum of a spatio-temporal mean and fluctuations,
FORMULA 
Here we assume the mean velocity profile is known a priori from an eddy viscosity model {{cite:6bdd1ca5-4a49-437d-ae10-26ff5c9da369}} as discussed in {{cite:04b50cd6-6aa3-4795-9b2a-2ef9f987db74}}. We express the fluctuations as Fourier modes in the streamwise/spanwise directions and in time,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the streamwise wavenumber, FORMULA  is the spanwise wavenumber, and FORMULA  is the radial frequency. Upon elimination of the pressure term, we can express the governing equations in terms of the fluctuating vertical velocity FORMULA  and normal vorticity FORMULA ,

The wall-normal operators are discretized numerically with Chebyshev collocation points using the suite developed by {{cite:46689ee2-7e27-40b0-b26e-965ea757bcd2}}. We can recast Equation REF  into the following input/output form

As before, we can decompose the resolvent operator via the SVD as
FORMULA 
The off-diagonal term in FORMULA  is proportional to the mean shear FORMULA  which is maximum at the wall. It remains large in the inner region before it begins to decline in the log region. Similar to the model LNS operator in Section , mean shear is the primary source of non-normality leading to significant amplification. Its spatial variation is important since it has been shown {{cite:6efd3bc5-41f0-4184-8286-db67bba78a69}} that a critical-layer mechanism tends to localize activity at the wall-normal location where the phase speed of the disturbance is equal to the local mean velocity. This is explored further by considering three particular wavenumber triplets that are representative of the near-wall cycle, a very large-scale motion (VLSM), and a stationary disturbance. The roles of normal and non-normal mechanisms are studied by analyzing the mode shapes of the leading resolvent response modes, the pseudospectrum of the LNS operator, and the resolvent norm compared with the inverse distance between the imaginary axis and the nearest eigenvalue.
FIGURE 

Near-wall cycle
The first wavenumber combination considered is FORMULA  which is representative of the near-wall cycle {{cite:6efd3bc5-41f0-4184-8286-db67bba78a69}}. Here the wavespeed is given by FORMULA . Figure REF  shows that the mean shear is very large at the wall-normal height where the wavespeed matches the local mean, resulting in the off-diagonal terms of the resolvent operator being large. This is similar to the model LNS operator in Equation REF  where the influence of non-normality concentrates energy in different velocity components for FORMULA  and FORMULA . The optimal resolvent forcing and response modes are plotted in Figure REF  to illustrate that the forcing is primarily concentrated in FORMULA  and FORMULA  while the response is mostly in FORMULA .
FIGURE 
The strength of mean shear suggests that pseudoresonance is the primary driver of the near-wall cycle mode. The spectrum as well as contours of the pseudospectrum are plotted in Figure REF  for various FORMULA . Figure REF  also includes the resolvent norm and the contribution from resonance which is quantified by FORMULA . The ratio of the resolvent norm to the contribution from resonance is 19.6, which is of the same order of magnitude as the value predicted by FORMULA  (see Table REF ). Nevertheless, it is clear from this discrepancy that amplification cannot be attributed to one particular eigenvalue and that there is no eigenvector which is proportional to the resolvent mode. Using the expression FORMULA  to quantify non-normality is problematic since there is no unique FORMULA  which is responsible for amplification.
The FORMULA  corresponding to FORMULA  is indicated by the horizontal, dashed blue line. At this frequency, the resolvent norm is significantly larger than the resonance term suggesting that amplification is due to non-normal mechanisms. This observation is confirmed by the spectrum where the least damped eigenvalues are clustered around higher frequencies and contributes to the resolvent norm for FORMULA .
FIGURE 
It is also worth noting that the eigenvalues are significantly damped, which results in the leading singular values being on the order of unity. While these are not large, the rank-1 approximation is still valid since the first pair of singular values is approximately one order of magnitude larger than the others as seen in Figure REF .
FIGURE 

VLSM
Further from the wall, the mean shear drops several orders of magnitude (see Figure REF ) and the effect of viscosity decreases. As a result, amplification becomes a mix of both normal and non-normal effects. To reinforce this point, a wavenumber triplet which is representative of a VLSM is considered. The mode shapes for FORMULA  are plotted in Figure REF .
FIGURE 
The forcing is dominated by the FORMULA -component while the response is dominated by the FORMULA -component. The FORMULA -component of the forcing, notably, is less significant than the near-wall cycle mode implying that the role of lift-up is not as pronounced for this mode. The spectrum associated with the streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers of the VLSM is plotted along with the pseudospectrum of the LNS operator in Figure REF .
FIGURE 
The results are drastically different from the near-wall cycle case as the resonant forcing of eigenvalues is greater than one so amplification is due to both terms on the right-hand side of Equation REF . Notably, the spectrum in Figure REF  resembles that of the base flow at FORMULA  for FORMULA , FORMULA  as there are three distinct branches. As observed by {{cite:89824b52-2a48-4df1-8a06-300cc9ccb4a0}} and {{cite:dca6c2cd-f175-4edf-b4ed-c385c7904eac}}, the eigenvalues at the intersection of the branches are the most sensitive to perturbations and result in very large non-normal amplification. The product FORMULA  while FORMULA  = 34.9 (see Table REF ), suggesting that the nonorthogonality of many eigenfunctions leads to high pseudoresonance. Similar to the near-wall cycle case, there are no eigenvalues which exactly match the wave speed associated with the VLSM. The eigenvalue close to the dotted blue line in Figure REF , however, does seem to impact the resolvent norm which has an extra bump near its maximum value. This is also reflected in the red dotted line since the eigenvalue protrudes from the distinct Y-shape of the spectrum. The maximum singular values are on the order of FORMULA  and the resolvent operator is low-rank as seen in Figure REF .
FIGURE 

Stationary disturbances
Finally, we consider stationary disturbances which tend to be the most amplified by the resolvent operator with singular values exceeding FORMULA . The specific wavenumber triplet selected for this study is FORMULA . The roots behind such large amplification can be traced back to the model operator in Equation REF . In this example, the FORMULA  resulting in a low-rank system which concentrated all the forcing energy in the second velocity component and the response energy in the first velocity component. When FORMULA , all of the diagonal terms of the resolvent become order FORMULA  small since imaginary terms are eliminated and FORMULA  scales with FORMULA . Thus, when the LNS operator is inverted, the determinant, which is the product of the diagonal terms, is very small. The energy for the forcing is almost totally in the wall-normal and spanwise components as seen in Figure REF  while the response is almost totally in the streamwise component.
FIGURE 
Similar to the near-wall cycle and VLSM modes, the spectrum and contours of the pseudospectrum are presented in Figure REF  alongside the resolvent norm and contribution from resonance. All of the eigenvalues are real since the imaginary terms are eliminated from the resolvent operator when FORMULA . Another implication of eliminating mean flow advection, as mentioned by {{cite:35c951de-33c2-4eab-af1d-a5354c33966b}}, is that the Orr mechanism is absent from this mode.
FIGURE 
Stationary disturbances are highly amplified and the singular values are plotted in Figure REF . The rank-1 approximation is quite applicable for this particular mode as the leading pair of singular values is on the order of FORMULA . Moreover, the contribution from non-normality is well approximated by FORMULA  which agrees quite well with FORMULA  = 278. Such agreement can be attributed to the eigenvalue closest to the imaginary axis which has an imaginary component that agrees with the most amplified frequency. Unlike the cylinder case where there exists a convective-type non-normality, the FORMULA  modes are an example of the component-type non-normality and so FORMULA  is small since the velocity for the forcing mode is almost completely concentrated in the wall-normal plane while the velocity for the response mode is nearly all in the streamwise direction.
FIGURE 

Predicting low-rank nature of resolvent
We briefly return to the discussion of predicting when the resolvent operator may be low-rank. When the LNS operator is inverted, the terms which were originally small along the diagonal become large leading to a large resolvent norm. Marginally stable eigenvalues or stationary disturbances have large amplification since either one term along the diagonal is small when forcing at a resonant frequency or all the terms along the diagonal are small since FORMULA . The system is low-rank roughly speaking if the largest entry of the resolvent operator is appreciably larger than the other terms. This can happen when the off-diagonal are terms are large with respect to the diagonal as is the case for the near-wall cycle and stationary disturbance modes or when one term along the diagonal is small as is the case for the cylinder. If the frequency of the forcing excites two eigenvalues then two diagonal terms of the resolvent operator are large and the system is not rank-1 even though there might be significant amplification (see Appendix ).

Influence of spatial wavenumber and wave speed
Based on the findings of this study and observations from {{cite:54ca8aa1-5066-4694-ae8e-8b304efefcd4}}, it is possible to categorize amplification mechanisms in wall-bounded turbulence as either normal or non-normal depending on the wavenumber vector FORMULA  selected. When FORMULA  is small, the influence of both mean flow advection and viscosity is diminished resulting in a non-normal system where there is high amplification. Low-order modes (those corresponding to the largest singular values), experience high amplification due to both normality and non-normality. Higher-order modes also experience amplification due to non-normality. At higher FORMULA , only low-order modes are amplified as long as they are localized near the critical layer. Higher-order modes experience low amplification which is proportional to viscosity. The wall-normal height, furthermore, has implications on the type of amplification as it influences the choice of wave speed FORMULA , or FORMULA , as well as the influence of mean shear FORMULA . Closer to the wall, the mean shear is highest while in the log region, mean shear still plays an important role resulting in preferential amplification of long streamwise structures.

Closing remarks
Conclusions
The preceding development and example operators provide a context in which to interpret the recent findings concerning analysis of the resolvent in the literature. Amplification quantified by the resolvent norm incorporates both normal and non-normal origins. In the limiting case of a normal operator, the condition number FORMULA  and resonance due to the eigenvalue is captured. For a non-normal operator, FORMULA  and pseudoresonant effects can lead to large amplification. The nature of the non-normality in the resolvent contains information about the transfer mechanisms from inputs to outputs and may impact the distribution of energy among different velocity components. The inverse of the inner product FORMULA , which is unity for a purely normal mechanism and zero for a purely non-normal mechanism, quantifies the degree to which the amplification is non-normal. In the presence of mean shear, there is always some degree of non-normality so a mechanism can be considered normal in character if FORMULA  is close to unity.
The model resolvent operator is also non-self-adjoint unless there is no mean shear, the eigenvalues are real, and the disturbances are stationary (FORMULA ). If the eigenvalues are purely imaginary and there is no spatial dependence, the resolvent forcing and response modes are FORMULA  out of phase. In a spatially-developing flow, this translates to the spatial support of the forcing mode being upstream that of the response mode. It is also possible to observe the Orr mechanism which aligns the resolvent response and forcing modes with and against the mean shear, respectively. If there is reverse flow, the modes overlap and form a wavemaker which is approximately coincident with the region of the flow that is absolute unstable. Non-normality can still be quantified via FORMULA , which tends to infinity for a purely convective-type instability mechanism. It is concluded that mode shapes and locations can be generalized depending on the strength of lift-up and mean flow advection.
These findings are applicable to both base and mean velocity profiles, but there is an important distinction. For a base flow, the input forcing must be provided by an external source. Therefore, the most amplified structure is of interest as it is likely to be present in the flow when it becomes unsteady. For the cylinder flow {{cite:469b3a58-ee81-4b95-a6b1-f185adc1c676}} and thermo-solutal convection {{cite:0b77f95f-8c77-409a-a2ae-fc3f37e31145}}, the operator is normal in character so the most amplified structure corresponds to an eigenvalue crossing the imaginary axis. This is not the case for non-normal operators {{cite:9ae0ef13-0675-45b7-83d4-2086bfe3d2c6}} as the highest amplification occurs for modes which do not correspond to an eigenvalue. For a mean flow, the nonlinear term is the source of intrinsic forcing so the goal is to predict the structure of the unsteady flow {{cite:d948b12b-9e98-4a04-9076-b89abfdedee9}}. In many cases, the most amplified response is normal in character and accounts for a significant amount of the kinetic energy of the velocity fluctuations {{cite:6efd3bc5-41f0-4184-8286-db67bba78a69}}, {{cite:49608752-73b7-4bc7-9011-071cf47b0965}}. There are circumstances, however, where it does not give the complete picture as the rank-1 approximation is no longer valid and suboptimal modes need to be considered.
Expressing the resolvent operator as the outer products of eigenmodes clarifies the connection between stability and resolvent analysis. Furthermore, it becomes apparent that mean stability analysis is successful when the amplification is due to forcing at a frequency in the vicinity of a unique eigenvalue. In such circumstances, the forward and adjoint stability modes are proportional to the optimal forcing and response modes at that frequency. Both sets of modes form a rank-1 approximation, which fails if the eigenvalues are clustered together, of the resolvent operator. Cylinder flow is chosen to demonstrate the similarity of stability and resolvent modes when resonance outweighs pseudoresonance at a particular frequency. In both the base flow and mean flow cases, amplification occurs at a single frequency corresponding to the imaginary part of the least stable eigenvalue. The resolvent modes approximate the region of the flow which is absolutely unstable by identifying the wavemaker. There is no wavemaker at very low Reynolds numbers when the flow is only convectively unstable. The cylinder exemplifies a convective-type non-normality where mean flow advection separates the spatial support of the forcing mode to be upstream of the response mode as long as FORMULA . Non-normality quantified by FORMULA  agrees well with FORMULA  for both the base and mean flows.
It is important to note that only normal mechanisms are active in cylinder flow whereas in more complicated flows such as wall-bounded turbulence, both normal and non-normal mechanisms are relevant. Three different wavenumber triplets, representative of the near-wall cycle, VLSM's, and stationary disturbances, highlight the competing influences of viscous dissipation, mean flow advection, and mean shear on not only the most amplified modes but also the spectrum and pseudospectrum. The importance of each term depends significantly on the wall-normal height where the perturbations are localized. In the inner region where there is very high mean shear and viscosity is most important, amplification is primarily due to pseudoresonant mechanisms. Forcing in the spanwise/wall-normal plane leads to a large response in the streamwise direction as seen for the near-wall cycle mode. The eigenvalues are highly damped yet the resolvent norm is on the order of unity due to the high sensitivity of the spectrum to perturbations. In the log region, mean shear and consequently lift-up are weaker yet the declining importance of viscosity results in eigenvalues which are closer to the imaginary axis. The most amplified disturbance corresponding to the wavespeed of the VLSM, nevertheless, is primarily due to pseudoresonance. Consequently, there is poorer agreement between non-normality quantified by FORMULA  and FORMULA  as it is clear that amplification can no longer be attributed to a single eigenvalue in the spectrum. Mean flow advection results in the Orr mechanism {{cite:e2129237-c747-4283-aa9c-00314304a365}} and hence less overlap between the forcing and response modes.
Stationary disturbances are the globally most amplified disturbances by effectively leveraging mean shear. The perturbation energy is almost exclusively concentrated in the FORMULA  and FORMULA -components of the forcing mode and in the FORMULA -component of the response mode. Assuming streamwise constant disturbances eliminates the mean flow advection term from the resolvent operator and hence suppresses the Orr mechanism. All of the non-normality, consequently, can be classified as a component-type non-normality, in contrast to the cylinder flow, and the eigenvalues of the LNS operator are real. Non-normality quantified by FORMULA  agrees well with FORMULA  since amplification can be attributed to the eigenvalue closest to the imaginary axis. For a generic wavenumber triplet, the applicability of the rank-1 approximation can be approximated by the ratio of the largest term in the resolvent operator to the other entries. Finally, the distribution of energy among various velocity components may be useful when considering how the nonlinear term, which can be computed from resolvent response modes {{cite:0dd80617-e8b5-4274-b260-67337eac876e}}, projects onto the optimal resolvent forcing modes.

Reduced-order modeling and control
In the pseudo-resonance limit case discussed in Section , it was demonstrated that a single resolvent forcing/response pair could characterize the most amplified disturbance. The same could not be said of the eigenvectors which were nearly parallel to one another. In reduced-order modeling applications, the resolvent modes could be a superior basis to the stability modes, since fewer are needed to represent the most important behavior of the flow. In the context of control, where reduced-order models play a key role in rendering the problem computationally tractable, stability modes have been shown by {{cite:fd67737a-39af-4503-9c01-d670f8bd55cb}} to be less effective at representing the input-output behavior of the system. While their study did not consider resolvent modes as an expansion basis for model reduction, their capability of capturing the intrinsic dynamics (stability-related phenomena) as well as non-modal growth could make them an ideal candidate. Resolvent modes can also provide relevant information in regard to where to place sensors and actuators.
The resolvent response modes are outputs which are highly amplified by the linear dynamics of the NSE, and so sensors could be placed where these are likely to be strong. The resolvent forcing modes are the `trigger' or input which leads to high amplification, and so the actuators could be placed to manipulate the flow in such a way that suppresses these disturbances.
Note, however, that in cases where there is large spatial separation between resolvent forcing and response modes, it is possible that improved performance could be attained by sensing and actuating within a wavemaker region {{cite:09a695e5-a76f-461d-8cf4-f274de84ba8f}}, {{cite:aea48712-e6d6-48da-88bf-410632cc5941}}, which, as discussed in Section , may also be estimated from resolvent analysis. While the resolvent decomposition shows potential for control applications {{cite:eb9f0fe2-ccf0-4e24-8fff-a017bc991bc9}}, further refinements could seek to balance the observability and controllability of the reduced-order model {{cite:d738a1da-8315-4b3c-a81e-351e6f980a42}}, {{cite:2495aec2-2ef2-461e-ac25-60a1d0b6be98}}, subject to known sensor and actuator locations, and information about the nature of the nonlinear forcing.

Rank-1 example
An important result of this paper is that the rank-1 approximation fails when there is not sufficient separation of eigenvalues at the frequency of interest. The two operators FORMULA  and FORMULA  in Equation REF , which are nearly identical except for the frequency of the second eigenvalue, illustrate this point. In the case of FORMULA , substituting the eigenvalues into Equation REF  results in two terms of roughly equal importance leading to the failure of the rank-1 approximation as seen in Figure REF  where the singular values of the resolvent operator for both FORMULA  and FORMULA  are plotted. The rank-1 approximation works better for FORMULA  since there is a clear separation of singular values at the resonant frequencies.
