Let FORMULA  be a locally compact group with cocompact connected
component. We prove that the assembly map from the topological
FORMULA -theory of FORMULA  to the FORMULA -theory of the reduced FORMULA -algebra
of FORMULA  is an isomorphism.

Introduction and statement of results
In this paper we give a proof of the Connes-Kasparov conjecture for
almost connected groups. To be more precise, we prove the following
Theorem 1.1 
Let FORMULA  be a second countable almost connected group (i.e., FORMULA 
is compact, where FORMULA  denotes the connected component of FORMULA ).
Then FORMULA  satisfies the Baum-Connes conjecture with trivial
coefficients FORMULA , i.e., if FORMULA  denotes the
topological FORMULA -theory of FORMULA , then the Baum-Connes assembly map
FORMULA 
is an isomorphism.

It was already shown by Kasparov in {{cite:73925548-45c5-4de8-9602-506ea1aa1884}} that the theorem is
true if FORMULA  is amenable. In fact, by a more recent result of Higson
and Kasparov, we know that the Baum-Connes conjecture with arbitrary
coefficients holds for any amenable group. By work of A. Wassermann
{{cite:f79c627c-9040-4393-bbc1-1fbbdee45980}}, we also know that the result is true for all connected
reductive linear Lie groups. More recently, Lafforgue used quite
different methods to give a proof of the conjecture for all connected
semi-simple groups with finite center (which are not necessarily
linear). The main idea of the proof of the general result of Theorem
REF  is to use the Mackey-machine approach, as outlined in
{{cite:2c66253f-f958-4643-98d6-010fc43f23e2}}, in order to reduce to the reductive case. The strategy
for doing this bases heavily on some ideas presented in Pukánszky's
recent book {{cite:2e3e99e9-4d8c-4c9d-b41c-6493561ccef2}} where he reports on his deep analysis of the
representation theory of connected groups. In particular the methods
of his proof that locally algebraic connected real Lie groups are type
I, presented on the first four pages of his book, where most
enlightening.
The above theorem is actually a special case of a more general result
which we shall explain below. If FORMULA  is a second countable locally
compact group, then by a FORMULA -algebra FORMULA  we shall always understand a
FORMULA -algebra FORMULA  equipped with a strongly continuous action of FORMULA  by
FORMULA -automorphisms of FORMULA . Let FORMULA  denote a locally compact
universal proper FORMULA -space in the sense of {{cite:b1753972-5629-4ec8-9ff3-2440f22f2c04}} (we refer to
{{cite:f60e7e3f-6b6c-43ea-be2f-62d66c924da1}} for a discussion about the relation to the notion of
universal proper FORMULA -space as introduced by Baum, Connes and Higson in
{{cite:c8ad20b2-eac1-444d-ac60-885da5677da8}}). If FORMULA  is a FORMULA -algebra, the topological FORMULA -theory of
FORMULA  with coefficients in FORMULA  is defined as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  runs through
the FORMULA -compact subspaces of FORMULA  (i.e., FORMULA  is compact) ordered
by inclusion, and FORMULA  denotes Kasparov's equivariant
FORMULA -theory. If FORMULA , we simply write FORMULA  for
FORMULA .
The construction of Baum, Connes and Higson presented in {{cite:c8ad20b2-eac1-444d-ac60-885da5677da8}} determines a homomorphism
FORMULA 
usually called the
assembly map. We say that FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA  (i.e., FORMULA 
satisfies the Baum-Connes conjecture for the coefficient algebra FORMULA ),
if FORMULA  is an isomorphism. Theorem REF  is then a
special case of
Theorem 1.2 
Suppose that FORMULA  is any second countable locally compact group such
that FORMULA  satisfies BC for arbitrary coefficients, where FORMULA 
denotes the connected component of FORMULA . (By the results of Higson
and Kasparov {{cite:eaaa1ad2-7984-4bb8-a323-66b3a450b722}} this is in particular true if FORMULA  is
amenable or, more general, if FORMULA  satisfies the Haagerup
property.) Then FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA , FORMULA  a separable
Hilbert space, with respect to any action of FORMULA  on FORMULA .

It is well known that in case of almost connected groups, the
topological FORMULA -theory FORMULA  has a very nice description
in terms of the maximal compact subgroup FORMULA  of FORMULA . In fact, under
some mild extra conditions on FORMULA , the group FORMULA  can be
computed by means of the FORMULA -theory of the crossed product FORMULA . We give a brief discussion of these relations in §
below. As was already pointed out in {{cite:d1ab7eeb-43d1-4bfd-9e59-c1a29ab4da6f}}, our results have
important applications to the study of square-integrable
representations. In fact, combining our results with {{cite:d1ab7eeb-43d1-4bfd-9e59-c1a29ab4da6f}} gives
Corollary 1.3 (cf {{cite:d1ab7eeb-43d1-4bfd-9e59-c1a29ab4da6f}}) 
Let FORMULA  be a connected unimodular Lie group. Then all
square-integrable factor representations of FORMULA  are type I.
Moreover, FORMULA  has no square-integrable factor representations if
FORMULA  is odd, where FORMULA  denotes the maximal compact subgroup
of FORMULA .

The paper is outlined as follows: In our preliminary section,
§, we recall the main results from {{cite:9569cc5f-21a8-436a-a084-c9db7025eba1}}, {{cite:2c66253f-f958-4643-98d6-010fc43f23e2}} on
the permanence properties of the Baum-Connes conjecture which are
needed in this work. We will also use these results to perform some
first reductions of the problem. In § we prove a
result on continuous fields of actions, showing under some mild
conditions on the group FORMULA  and the base space FORMULA  of the field, that
FORMULA  satisfies the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients in the
algebra of FORMULA -sections of the field if it satisfies the conjecture
for all fibres. This result will be another basic tool for the proof
our our main theorem.
In § we are concerned with the conjecture for reductive
groups. Using (and slightly extending) some recent results of
Lafforgue {{cite:7a3db8bb-45c4-4b07-b209-ce0549897be5}} on the conjecture for semi-simple groups with
finite center, we will show that the results on continuous fields
obtained in § imply that the conjecture (with trivial
coefficients) holds for all reductive groups without any linearity
conditions. In § we will then use Pukánzsky's
methods in combination with an extensive use of the permanence
properties for BC to give the final steps for the proof of Theorem
REF . In § we shall then discuss the
implications for almost connected groups as mentioned above. Note that
§ does not contain any new material, except the
conclusion drawn out of our main theorem.
Acknowledgments. The authors profited quite a lot from valuable
discussions with several friends and colleagues. We are most grateful

permanence properties for BC) to use the results of {{cite:9569cc5f-21a8-436a-a084-c9db7025eba1}}, {{cite:2c66253f-f958-4643-98d6-010fc43f23e2}} to
attack the Connes-Kasparov conjecture with trivial coefficients.

discussions or comments.

Some preliminaries and first reductions
Let us collect some general facts which were presented in {{cite:2c66253f-f958-4643-98d6-010fc43f23e2}}
– for the definitions of twisted actions and twisted equivariant
FORMULA -theory we refer to {{cite:9569cc5f-21a8-436a-a084-c9db7025eba1}}. Assume that FORMULA  is a second
countable group and let FORMULA  be a FORMULA -FORMULA -algebra. We say that FORMULA 
satisfies BC with coefficients in FORMULA  if the assembly map
FORMULA 
is an isomorphism.
If FORMULA  is a closed normal subgroup of FORMULA , there exists a twisted
action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  such that the twisted crossed
product FORMULA  is canonically isomorphic to
FORMULA . Moreover, we can use the twisted equivariant
FORMULA -theory of {{cite:9569cc5f-21a8-436a-a084-c9db7025eba1}} to define the topological FORMULA -theory FORMULA  with respect to the twisted action of
FORMULA  on FORMULA , and a twisted version of the assembly map
FORMULA 
In {{cite:9569cc5f-21a8-436a-a084-c9db7025eba1}} we constructed a
partial assembly map
FORMULA 
such that the following diagram commutes
FORMULA 
Using this, the first two authors were able to prove the following
extension results:
Theorem 2.1 
Assume that FORMULA  is a FORMULA -algebra and let FORMULA  be a closed normal
subgroup of FORMULA . Let FORMULA  denote the quotient map and assume
that one of the following conditions is satisfied

FORMULA  has a compact open subgroup FORMULA  and for any
compact subgroup FORMULA  of FORMULA , the group
FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA .

FORMULA  has a FORMULA -element FORMULA 
(which is automatically true if FORMULA  is almost connected),
FORMULA  is almost connected and FORMULA  satisfies BC
for FORMULA , where FORMULA  is a maximal compact subgroup of
FORMULA .

Then the partial assembly map FORMULA  is an isomorphism. In particular,
FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  satisfies BC for
FORMULA .

See {{cite:2c66253f-f958-4643-98d6-010fc43f23e2}}.
In order to avoid the use of twisted actions we may use the version of
the Packer-Raeburn stabilization trick as given in {{cite:1dbe5aef-ebf0-46d6-86bd-61ff98e0ce8e}}, {{cite:faf5cf56-ce71-4df9-8b43-c3bd905eec67}}:
Proposition 2.2 (cf {{cite:1dbe5aef-ebf0-46d6-86bd-61ff98e0ce8e}} and {{cite:faf5cf56-ce71-4df9-8b43-c3bd905eec67}}) 
Assume that FORMULA  is a second countable group and let FORMULA  be a closed
normal subgroup of FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be a twisted action of
FORMULA  on the separable FORMULA -algebra FORMULA . Then there exists an
ordinary action FORMULA , FORMULA ,
such that FORMULA  is stably exterior equivalent (and hence Morita
equivalent) to FORMULA .

Note that BC is invariant under passing to Morita equivalent actions.
Thus, in order to conclude that FORMULA  satisfies BC for
FORMULA , it is enough to show that FORMULA  satisfies BC for
FORMULA  with respect to an appropriate action of
FORMULA  on FORMULA . In particular, if FORMULA  is
amenable, it follows that FORMULA  is always an
isomorphism.
In what follows we need to study the following special situation:
Assume that FORMULA  is an action of FORMULA  on FORMULA 
for some separable Hilbert space FORMULA . Since FORMULA , we can choose a Borel map FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  for all FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is a
homomorphism, we see that there exists a Borel cocycle FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
The class
FORMULA  is called the Mackey obstruction for
FORMULA  being unitary. Let
FORMULA 
be the central extension of FORMULA 
by FORMULA  corresponding to FORMULA , i.e., we have FORMULA 
with multiplication given by
FORMULA 
and the unique locally compact
group topology which generates the product Borel structure on FORMULA  (see {{cite:3713a1c1-e23c-4435-8a06-a8c2999ce101}}). Then the following is true
Lemma 2.3 
For each FORMULA  let FORMULA . Let
FORMULA  and FORMULA  be as above. Then FORMULA  is
Morita equivalent to the twisted action FORMULA  of
FORMULA  on FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be as in the discussion above, i.e., FORMULA  and FORMULA  for all FORMULA . Then it is easy
to check that FORMULA  defined by
FORMULA  is a homomorphism which implements the
desired equivalence on the FORMULA  bimodule FORMULA  (we refer to
{{cite:faf5cf56-ce71-4df9-8b43-c3bd905eec67}} for an extensive discussion of Morita equivalence for
twisted actions).
Another important result is the continuity of the Baum-Connes
conjecture with respect to inductive limits of the coefficients, at
least if FORMULA  is exact. For this we need
Lemma 2.4 
Assume that FORMULA  is an inductive system of FORMULA -algebras
and let FORMULA  be the FORMULA -algebraic inductive limit.
Assume further that one of the following conditions is satisfied:

All connecting maps FORMULA , FORMULA  are injective,
or

FORMULA  is exact.

Then FORMULA  with respect to the obvious
connecting homomorphisms.

If all connecting maps are injective, we may
regard each FORMULA  as a subalgebra of FORMULA . But this implies that we
also have FORMULA  as subalgebras of FORMULA , and hence
the inductive limit
FORMULA 
sits inside FORMULA . But it is easy to check that
FORMULA  is dense in
FORMULA .
Suppose now that FORMULA  is exact. In this situation we want to reduce
the proof to situation (i). Consider the canonical homomorphisms
FORMULA . Let FORMULA  and let
FORMULA , where the FORMULA  denote the
connecting homomorphisms for FORMULA . Of course, if FORMULA  then FORMULA , so for each FORMULA  the system
FORMULA  is an inductive system with injective
connecting maps. It follows directly from the definition of the
inductive limit that FORMULA , and hence it follows from (i) that
FORMULA . By exactness of
FORMULA  it follows that FORMULA  is the kernel of
FORMULA . By the previous
discussion it follows that FORMULA  is also the kernel of the canonical
homomorphism FORMULA . Thus, dividing
out the kernels, i.e., by considering the system FORMULA 
with FORMULA  we conclude from another use of (i) that
FORMULA 
As a direct consequence we obtain
Proposition 2.5 
Assume that the FORMULA -algebra FORMULA  is an inductive limit of the
FORMULA -algebras FORMULA , FORMULA , such that FORMULA  satisfies BC for all
FORMULA . Assume further that FORMULA  is exact or that all connecting
homomorphisms FORMULA  are injective. Then FORMULA  satisfies BC for
FORMULA .

It follows from Lemma REF  and the continuity of
FORMULA -theory that FORMULA . On
the other side, it is shown in {{cite:2c66253f-f958-4643-98d6-010fc43f23e2}} that
FORMULA . Since by assumption
FORMULA  via the assembly map,
and since the assembly map commutes with the FORMULA -theory maps induced
by the FORMULA -equivariant homomorphism FORMULA , the result
follows.
As a first application we get
Proposition 2.6 
Let FORMULA  be a separable locally compact group such that FORMULA 
satisfies BC for arbitrary coefficients. Then the following are
equivalent:

For every central extension FORMULA  the group FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA .

FORMULA  satisfies BC with coefficients in the compact
operators FORMULA  for all separable Hilbert spaces FORMULA 
and with respect to all possible actions of FORMULA  on FORMULA .


Assume that (1) holds. Let FORMULA  be any action of
FORMULA  on FORMULA  and let FORMULA  denote the Mackey
obstruction for this action. Let
FORMULA 
denote the central extension
determined by FORMULA . It follows from Lemma REF  that
FORMULA  is Morita equivalent to the twisted action FORMULA 
of FORMULA  on FORMULA . By assumption, we know that FORMULA 
satisfies BC for FORMULA . It follows from Theorem REF  that
FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA , or,
equivalently, that FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA  with respect
to the appropriate action of FORMULA  (use Proposition REF ).
Since our group FORMULA  does not satisfy directly the assumptions of
Theorem REF , let us briefly explain how it is used: first
apply part (i) of Theorem REF  to FORMULA , which implies
that FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA  if and only if every compact
extension FORMULA  of FORMULA  in FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA , and
then apply part (ii) of Theorem REF  to the subgroup FORMULA 
of FORMULA .
Writing FORMULA , the twisted action of
FORMULA  is given by the twisted action FORMULA  of
FORMULA  on the n'th summand. Let FORMULA  be
the projection on the summand corresponding to FORMULA . Consider
the diagram
FORMULA 
(Here the topological FORMULA -theory FORMULA  is computed
with respected to the twisted action FORMULA  of FORMULA  and FORMULA  denotes the twisted assembly map!)
Since
the vertical arrows are split-surjective and the upper horizontal
arrow is bijective, it follows that the lower horizontal arrow is also
bijective. Thus we see that FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA 
with respect to the twisted action FORMULA . By Morita
equivalence this implies that FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA  with respect
to FORMULA .
For the opposite direction assume that (2) holds. Let FORMULA  be as in (1). As explained above it follows from
Theorem REF  that FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA  if
FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA . Using the
stabilization trick, the latter is true if FORMULA  satisfies BC for
FORMULA  with respect to an appropriate action of FORMULA  on
FORMULA  which fixes the base FORMULA . Using continuity of BC,
this follows easily from the fact that FORMULA  satisfies BC for arbitrary
actions on FORMULA .
We also need a result on induced algebras as obtained in
{{cite:2c66253f-f958-4643-98d6-010fc43f23e2}}. For this recall that if FORMULA  is a closed subgroup of FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is an FORMULA -algebra, then the induced algebra FORMULA  is
defined as
FORMULA 
Equipped with the
pointwise operations and the supremum-norm, FORMULA  becomes a
FORMULA -algebra with FORMULA -action defined by
FORMULA 
The following result follows from
{{cite:2c66253f-f958-4643-98d6-010fc43f23e2}}:
Theorem 2.7 
Let FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  be as above. Then G satisfies BC
for FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA .

The result becomes most valuable for us when combined with the
following result of {{cite:192f8749-ea46-431c-95c1-5cbbddf30468}}:
Proposition 2.8 
Suppose that FORMULA  is a closed subgroup of FORMULA  and FORMULA  is a
FORMULA -algebra. Let FORMULA  denote the set of equivalence classes
of irreducible representations of FORMULA  equipped with the usual
FORMULA -action defined by FORMULA . Then FORMULA 
is isomorphic (as a FORMULA -algebra) to FORMULA  for some FORMULA -algebra
FORMULA  if and only if there exists a FORMULA -equivariant continuous map
FORMULA . Moreover, if FORMULA  is such a map, then FORMULA  can be chosen to be FORMULA , with
FORMULA  equipped with the obvious
FORMULA -action.

As a corollary of Theorem REF  and Proposition
REF  we get in particular:
Corollary 2.9 
Suppose that FORMULA  is a locally compact group and FORMULA  is a FORMULA -algebra
which is type I and such that FORMULA  acts transitively on
FORMULA . Let FORMULA  and let FORMULA  denote the
stabilizer of FORMULA  for the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA . Then FORMULA 
satisfies BC for FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  satisfies BC for
FORMULA , where FORMULA  denotes the Hilbert
space of FORMULA .

Since there is only one orbit for the FORMULA -action on FORMULA ,
it follows from results of Glimm {{cite:974ad3b3-e4a9-4914-a32c-88bbf54fcd8b}}, that FORMULA  is
homeomorphic to FORMULA  via FORMULA . In
particular, it follows that FORMULA  is Hausdorff, which
implies that FORMULA . The inverse of
the above map is clearly a continuous FORMULA -equivariant map of
FORMULA  to FORMULA , and Proposition REF 
then implies that FORMULA . The result
then follows from Theorem REF .
We now give a short outline of the proof of Theorem REF .
The main work is required for proving the following proposition:
Proposition 2.10 
Assume that FORMULA  is a Lie group with finitely many components and let
FORMULA  be an action of FORMULA  on the compact operators
on some separable Hilbert space FORMULA . Then FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA .

The body of this paper is devoted to give a proof of this proposition
by using induction on the dimension of FORMULA . It is fairly easy to see
that the above proposition implies Theorem REF . Indeed,
using the first part of Theorem REF  we can directly reduce
to the case where FORMULA  is almost connected. Hence Theorem
REF  follows from
Proposition 2.11 
Suppose that Proposition REF  holds. Let FORMULA  be any
almost connected group and let FORMULA  be any action
of FORMULA  on the compact operators on some separable Hilbert space FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  satisfies BC with coefficients in FORMULA .

By the structure theory of almost connected groups
(e.g. see {{cite:825352a6-b00c-4148-a697-46993837e36d}}) we can find a compact normal subgroup
FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is a Lie group with finitely many
components. Using Theorem REF  we see that FORMULA  satisfies
BC for FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA 
(with respect to an appropriate twisted action). Since FORMULA  is
compact, it follows that FORMULA  is discrete, and
(after stabilizing if necessary), FORMULA . Let
FORMULA  and let FORMULA  denote the space of
FORMULA -orbits in FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is discrete, the same is true
for FORMULA , and we get a decomposition FORMULA . By
continuity of BC (see Proposition REF ), we conclude
that FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA  for all FORMULA . Using Corollary REF , this will follow if all
stabilizers FORMULA  satisfy BC for FORMULA .
But since FORMULA  is discrete, it follows that each stabilizer
FORMULA  contains the connected component FORMULA  of
FORMULA . Thus, each stabilizer is a Lie group with finitely many
components and the result will follow from Proposition
REF .
As mentioned above, the main idea for the proof of Proposition
REF  is to use induction on the dimension FORMULA  of the
Lie group FORMULA . For this we were very much influenced by Pukánszky's
proof of the fact that locally algebraic groups (i.e., Lie groups
having the same Lie algebra as some real algebraic group) have type I
group FORMULA -algebras as presented in his recent book {{cite:2e3e99e9-4d8c-4c9d-b41c-6493561ccef2}}. We
split the induction argument into two main parts, which deal with the
cases whether FORMULA  is semi-simple or not. Note that even in the
semi-simple case the result does not follow directly from the existent
results, since all known results only work for trivial coefficients
and require that the groups have finite centers.

Baum-Connes for continuous fields of FORMULA -algebras
Let FORMULA  be a separable locally compact group. Then FORMULA  is called
FORMULA -exact, if the functor FORMULA  is half-exact,
that is: whenever FORMULA  is a short exact sequence
of FORMULA -algebras, then the sequence
FORMULA 
is
exact in the middle term. Clearly, every exact group is FORMULA -exact.
Note that every almost connected group is exact by {{cite:e23b2500-c56e-47ab-87df-1a11d2c05b3c}}.
Recall also that an element FORMULA  is called a
FORMULA -element for FORMULA  if there exists a locally compact
proper FORMULA -space FORMULA , a FORMULA -algebra FORMULA  equipped with a
nondegenerate and FORMULA -equivariant FORMULA -homomorphism FORMULA , the center of the multiplier algebra FORMULA  of FORMULA , and (Dirac
and dual-Dirac) elements
FORMULA 
such that
FORMULA 
for all locally compact proper FORMULA -spaces FORMULA ,
where FORMULA . It is a basic result of Kasparov
{{cite:af5442ae-d4b5-4753-899e-e8e7839c2478}} that every almost connected group has a
FORMULA -element and it follows also from the work of Kasparov (but
see also {{cite:6efe084e-64ca-419d-a57f-64268c9a7c64}}) that a FORMULA -element of FORMULA  is unique and
that it is an idempotent with the remarkable property that for every
FORMULA -algebra FORMULA  the image FORMULA  of the
assembly map is equal to the FORMULA -part
FORMULA 
Here and below, we denote by
FORMULA  the (reduced)
descent homomorphism of Kasparov and we denote by FORMULA  the external tensor
product homomorphism (see {{cite:af5442ae-d4b5-4753-899e-e8e7839c2478}}). Note that it
follows from the above discussion that a group FORMULA  with
FORMULA -element satisfies BC for a given FORMULA -algebra FORMULA  if and only
if FORMULA  (i.e., FORMULA ) acts as the identity on
FORMULA . We want to exploit these facts to prove the
following basic result:
Proposition 3.1 
Suppose that FORMULA  is a separable locally compact space which can be
realized as the geometric realization of a (probably infinite)
finite dimensional simplicial complex. Let FORMULA  be the algebra of
FORMULA -sections of a continuous field of FORMULA -algebras FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be a FORMULA -linear action of
FORMULA  on FORMULA . Assume further that FORMULA  is exact and has a
FORMULA -element FORMULA . Then, if FORMULA 
satisfies BC with coefficients in each fibre FORMULA , FORMULA  satisfies BC
for FORMULA .

For the general notion of continuous fields of FORMULA -algebras and
their basic properties we refer to {{cite:d42799c5-cf72-4637-b118-77dc7dd1bed4}}, {{cite:6b3e6d63-472b-43de-92eb-1ad113f13497}}, {{cite:a0bff5b8-8805-4559-b8a7-fbf86ae956b3}}, {{cite:7ab7feca-91c6-40dc-b878-c044c9192473}}.
The idea of the proof is to show first that it holds for any closed
interval FORMULA . Then a short induction argument will show
that it holds for any cube in FORMULA . Then the result will follow
from a Mayer-Vietoris argument. For the proof we first need the
following lemma.
Lemma 3.2 
Assume that FORMULA  is a FORMULA -exact group with a FORMULA -element
FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be a FORMULA -algebra and let
FORMULA  be a FORMULA -invariant closed ideal of FORMULA . Then there
is a natural six-term exact sequence
FORMULA 

Since FORMULA  is FORMULA -exact, it follows that FORMULA 
is a homotopy invariant and half-exact functor on the category of
FORMULA -FORMULA -algebras which also satisfies Bott-periodicity (with
respect to the trivial FORMULA -action on FORMULA ). Then it follows
from some general arguments (e.g., see {{cite:d6238d4c-f212-46bb-8492-523a7109004f}}) that
there exists a six-term exact sequence
FORMULA 
We want to show that all maps in the sequence commute with
multiplication with the FORMULA -element. By the construction of the
connecting maps in the above sequence as given in {{cite:d6238d4c-f212-46bb-8492-523a7109004f}}, it is enough to show that for any pair of FORMULA -algebras FORMULA 
and FORMULA  and any  FORMULA
FORMULA 
commutes with multiplication with
FORMULA . But for this it is enough to show that
FORMULA 
This follows from
the fact that the descent homomorphism FORMULA  is compatible with
Kasparov products and the fact that
FORMULA 
which follows from {{cite:af5442ae-d4b5-4753-899e-e8e7839c2478}}.
It follows now that multiplication with FORMULA  also commutes with
all maps in the above commutative diagram. Since FORMULA  is an
idempotent, it is now easy to see that the full six-term exact
sequence restricts to a six-term exact sequence on the
FORMULA -parts of the respective FORMULA -theory groups of the crossed
products.
Remark 3.3 
It is now a direct consequence of the above proposition that if FORMULA 
is a FORMULA -exact group possessing a FORMULA -element, and if FORMULA  is a short exact sequence of FORMULA -algebras, then
FORMULA  satisfying BC for two of the algebras in this sequence implies
that G satisfies BC for all three algebras in the sequence. The same
result holds without the assumption on the FORMULA -element (see
{{cite:2c66253f-f958-4643-98d6-010fc43f23e2}} – which was actually deduced as an easy
consequence of a result of Kasparov and Skandalis in {{cite:b1753972-5629-4ec8-9ff3-2440f22f2c04}}).

We also need the following easy lemma.
Lemma 3.4 
Assume that FORMULA  is a locally compact space and that FORMULA  is the
algebra of FORMULA -sections of the continuous field FORMULA 
of FORMULA -algebras. Assume further that FORMULA , FORMULA , such
that FORMULA  for some evaluation map FORMULA . Then
there exists a compact neighborhood FORMULA  of FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  in FORMULA , where FORMULA  denotes the
restriction of FORMULA  to FORMULA  and FORMULA  denotes the quotient
map.

We may assume without loss of generality that FORMULA  is
compact.
Using suspension, it is enough to give a proof for the case FORMULA .
In what follows, if FORMULA  is any FORMULA -algebra, we denote by FORMULA  the
algebra obtained from FORMULA  by adjoining a unit (even if FORMULA  is
already unital). Then FORMULA  is a continuous field of
FORMULA -algebras in a canonical way. The algebra FORMULA  of
sections can be written as the set of pairs FORMULA  with multiplication given pointwise by the multiplication
rule of the fibres FORMULA . Moreover, we have an obvious unital
embedding FORMULA .
Assume now that FORMULA  and FORMULA  are as in the lemma. We
represent FORMULA  as a formal difference FORMULA  for some projections
FORMULA . Since FORMULA  we may assume (after
increasing dimension if necessary) that there exists a unitary
FORMULA  such that FORMULA . After passing to
FORMULA  if
necessary, we may further assume that FORMULA  lies in the connected
component of the identity of FORMULA . Thus, there exists a
unitary FORMULA  such that FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is a
continuous section in FORMULA , it follows that there exists a
compact neighborhood FORMULA  of FORMULA  such that FORMULA 
for all FORMULA , which implies that FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA  denote the restrictions
of FORMULA  to FORMULA , respectively. But this shows that
FORMULA  in FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is exact, it follows from {{cite:7ab7feca-91c6-40dc-b878-c044c9192473}} that the
crossed products FORMULA  form a continuous
bundle such that FORMULA  is the algebra of continuous sections
of this bundle. We start with proving the result in the special
case where FORMULA .
Recall from the above discussions that FORMULA  satisfies BC for a given
FORMULA -algebra FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA . In particular, it follows from our
assumptions that FORMULA  for all
FORMULA . Assume now that FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and let FORMULA  denote the
evaluation maps for each FORMULA . Then FORMULA  for all FORMULA . Thus,
using Lemma REF , we see that there exists a partition
FORMULA  such that FORMULA  in FORMULA . Now let
FORMULA  and let FORMULA . It follows from the
exact sequence
FORMULA 
that there exists a FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  is the image of FORMULA  under the inclusion. Since
FORMULA 
we may write
FORMULA  with FORMULA  for each FORMULA . Thus it is enough to show that FORMULA  for each FORMULA . In what follows, we write FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Since FORMULA  for all FORMULA  we obtain a
six-term exact sequence
FORMULA 
Since the image of FORMULA  in FORMULA  coincides
with the image of FORMULA  in FORMULA , we see that
FORMULA  maps to 0 under the isomorphism FORMULA , so
FORMULA .
We now show by induction on FORMULA  that the result is true for
FORMULA . For this assume that FORMULA  is a continuous field over the cube and FORMULA  is the algebra
of continuous sections of this field. We write FORMULA  and put FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is a continuous field over
FORMULA  and FORMULA  is also the section algebra of this bundle. If
FORMULA  is a FORMULA -linear action on FORMULA , it is also
FORMULA -linear with respect to the bundle structure of FORMULA  over
FORMULA  coming from the above decomposition of the cube. Moreover,
the actions on the fibres FORMULA  are clearly FORMULA -linear,
so by the induction assumption we know that FORMULA  satisfies BC with
coefficients in FORMULA  for all FORMULA . We now apply the above
result to the bundle FORMULA  to conclude that FORMULA 
satisfies BC with coefficients in FORMULA .
In a next step we show that the result holds for the open cubes
FORMULA . By similar arguments as given above it
suffices to show that the result holds for open intervals. So assume
that FORMULA  is a continuous field with section algebra
FORMULA . Let FORMULA . Then it follows from the first part of
the proof that FORMULA  satisfies BC with coefficients in FORMULA .
Since, by assumption, FORMULA  also satisfies BC for the fibres, a six-term
sequence argument shows that it also satisfies BC with coefficients in
FORMULA . Writing FORMULA  and using continuity of the BC conjecture, it
follows that FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA .
Since the result of the proposition is clearly invariant under
replacing the space FORMULA  by a homeomorphic space FORMULA , we now see that
the result holds for all open or closed simplices. We now proof the
general result for simplicial complexes via induction on the dimension
of the complex. By continuity of the conjecture, the result is clear
for zero-dimensional complexes. If FORMULA  has dimension FORMULA , let FORMULA 
denote the interiors of all FORMULA -dimensional simplices in FORMULA . Then
FORMULA  is homeomorphic to a disjoint union of open FORMULA -dimensional
cubes, so the result holds for FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is a
simplicial complex of dimension FORMULA , the result is true for
FORMULA  by the induction assumption. The result then
follows from another easy application of the six-term sequence (see
Remark REF ).
Remark 3.5 
Let FORMULA  be a second countable locally compact group and let FORMULA  be a
second countable locally compact FORMULA -space. Following Glimm we say
that the quotient space FORMULA  is countably separated, if all
orbits FORMULA  are locally closed, i.e. FORMULA  is open in its closure
FORMULA . Glimm showed in {{cite:974ad3b3-e4a9-4914-a32c-88bbf54fcd8b}} that FORMULA 
being countably separated is equivalent to each of the following
conditions:

The canonical map FORMULA  is a
homeomorphism for each FORMULA .

There exists a sequence of FORMULA -invariant open subsets
FORMULA  of FORMULA , where FORMULA  runs through the ordinal
numbers such that

FORMULA  for each FORMULA  and
FORMULA  is Hausdorff.

If FORMULA  is a limit ordinal, then
FORMULA .

There exits an ordinal number FORMULA  such that
FORMULA .


Unfortunately, in order to apply our bundle results to such actions,
we need to know that the spaces FORMULA  have a simplicial structure as required in Proposition
REF . However, we can summarize the above results to
prove the following theorem which turns out to be sufficient for our
purposes:

Theorem 3.6 
Suppose that FORMULA  is a second countable exact group which has a
FORMULA -element. Let FORMULA  be a second countable locally compact
FORMULA -space, let FORMULA  be a continuous bundle of
FORMULA -algebras over FORMULA  with section algebra FORMULA  and let
FORMULA  be an action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  which is compatible
with the given action of FORMULA  on FORMULA . Assume further that the
following assumptions are satisfied:

FORMULA  is countably separated.

There exists an increasing sequence of open FORMULA -invariant
subsets FORMULA  of FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  if FORMULA  is a limit ordinal
and FORMULA  for some FORMULA .

For each FORMULA  there exists a finite dimensional
simplicial complex FORMULA  and a continuous and open
surjection FORMULA  such that for all FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is a finite union of orbits in FORMULA .

Each stabilizer FORMULA , FORMULA , satisfies BC for FORMULA .

Then FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA .

For each ordinal FORMULA  let FORMULA 
denote the ideal corresponding to FORMULA . We show by transfinite
induction that FORMULA  satisfies BC with coefficients in FORMULA  for
each FORMULA . Since FORMULA  for some FORMULA , the result will
follow.
We start by showing that FORMULA  satisfies BC with coefficients in
FORMULA . Since the map FORMULA  is open, we can regard FORMULA 
as a section algebra of a continuous bundle over FORMULA  with fibres
isomorphic to FORMULA . By Proposition REF 
it is therefore sufficient to prove that FORMULA  satisfies BC for
FORMULA  for all FORMULA . Fix FORMULA  and put
FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is a finite union of FORMULA -orbits, we find
a finite sequence
FORMULA 
of
open invariant subsets of FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is a discrete finite set. To see this let FORMULA  be the
union of all closed FORMULA -orbits in FORMULA  (such orbits must exist by the
finiteness of FORMULA !). Then FORMULA  is closed in FORMULA  and FORMULA  is
discrete. Put FORMULA  and then define the FORMULA 's,
FORMULA , inductively by the same procedure. Using six-term sequences
(e.g., see Remark REF ), FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA  if
FORMULA  satisfies BC for all FORMULA , which in
turn follows if FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA  for any FORMULA -orbit
FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is homeomorphic to FORMULA  via the
canonical map (see Remark REF  above), it follows
from Proposition REF , that FORMULA  is
FORMULA -equivariantly isomorphic to FORMULA . Since, by
assumption, FORMULA  satisfies BC with coefficients in FORMULA , it
follows then from Theorem REF  that FORMULA  satisfies BC
with coefficients in FORMULA . This completes the proof for
FORMULA .
Assume now that FORMULA  is an ordinal number and that we have already
shown that FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA  for all FORMULA . If
FORMULA  for some ordinal FORMULA , it follows from the same
reasoning as for the case FORMULA  that FORMULA  satisfies BC for
FORMULA . Since FORMULA 
satisfies BC for FORMULA  by the induction assumption, it follows
from Remark REF  that FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA .
Assume now that FORMULA  is a limit ordinal and FORMULA  satisfies BC for
each FORMULA . Then FORMULA  which implies
that FORMULA  is the inductive limit of the
FORMULA . Thus it follows from Proposition REF  that
FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA .

The semi-simple case
In this section we want to show that Proposition REF  is
true if FORMULA  is semi-simple. For this we first have to obtain a slight
extension of Lafforgue's results on the Baum-Connes conjecture for
semi-simple groups with finite center.
Let us first recall the basic idea of Lafforgue's proof of the
Baum-Connes conjecture for such groups. If FORMULA  is a locally compact
group we let FORMULA  denote the convolution algebra of FORMULA  consisting
of continuous functions with compact supports. A norm FORMULA  on
FORMULA  is called good if convolution is continuous with
respect to this norm and if FORMULA  only depends on the absolute value
of FORMULA  for all FORMULA  (i.e., FORMULA  for all FORMULA ). A good completion FORMULA  of FORMULA  is a
completion with respect to a good norm on FORMULA . Note that
FORMULA  is always a good completion of FORMULA , but FORMULA  and
FORMULA  are in general not good completions of FORMULA .
If FORMULA  is a good completion of FORMULA , then Lafforgue
constructed an assembly map
FORMULA 
Moreover, if the identity on FORMULA  extends to a continuous
embedding FORMULA , he also shows that the
assembly map FORMULA  factors
through FORMULA , i.e.,
FORMULA 
(see {{cite:7a3db8bb-45c4-4b07-b209-ce0549897be5}}). Thus, if we know that FORMULA  is an
isomorphism for all good completions of FORMULA , and if we further
know that there exists a good completion FORMULA  such that the inclusion FORMULA  is an isomorphism, it follows that FORMULA  is an isomorphism. Note that
FORMULA  is an isomorphism
whenever FORMULA  is closed under holomorphic functional
calculus in FORMULA . Now Lafforgue was able to prove the following
deep results:
Theorem 4.1 (cf {{cite:7a3db8bb-45c4-4b07-b209-ce0549897be5}}) 

Assume that FORMULA  is a second countable locally compact group such
that FORMULA  acts isometrically and properly on a Riemannian manifold
with nonpositive sectional curvature which is bounded below. Then
FORMULA  is
an isomorphism for every good completion FORMULA  of
FORMULA .

In fact, Lafforgue was even able to show that the above result holds
with arbitrary FORMULA -algebra coefficients, but we do not need this
more general result here. Note that if FORMULA  is semi-simple with finite
center, then the Riemannian manifold of the theorem can be chosen to
be the symmetric space FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the maximal compact
subgroup of FORMULA .
In the second step for the proof of BC for semi-simple groups,
Lafforgue constructed a Schwartz-algebra FORMULA  which is a good completion of FORMULA  which is closed under
holomorphic functional calculus in FORMULA . In fact, this
construction followed a more general principle, which we are now going
to describe in more detail.
Assume that FORMULA  is a unimodular group and FORMULA  is a compact subgroup of
FORMULA . Then, following Lafforgue (see {{cite:7a3db8bb-45c4-4b07-b209-ce0549897be5}}), we say
that the pair FORMULA  satisfies property FORMULA  if the following
conditions are satisfied

There exists a continuous function FORMULA 
such that FORMULA , FORMULA  for all FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for all FORMULA .

There exists a continuous function FORMULA  such
that FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  for
all FORMULA  and FORMULA , and
FORMULA 
with respect to the normalized Haar measure on FORMULA .

There exists a FORMULA  such that
FORMULA  for all FORMULA .

If FORMULA  is a connected semi-simple group with finite center, and if FORMULA 
is the maximal compact subgroup of FORMULA , then Lafforgue was able to
show that FORMULA  satisfies (HC). The following theorem then completes
the proof of BC for connected semi-simple groups with finite center.
Theorem 4.2 (cf {{cite:7a3db8bb-45c4-4b07-b209-ce0549897be5}}) 
Assume that FORMULA  is a unimodular group and FORMULA  is a compact subgroup
of FORMULA  such that the pair FORMULA  satisfies (HC). Then there exists
a good completion FORMULA  of FORMULA  such
that FORMULA  is closed under holomorphic functional calculus
in FORMULA .

In order to extend Lafforgue's methods to extensions of semi-simple
groups, we first show that property (HC) is closed under compact
extensions.
Lemma 4.3 
Assume that FORMULA  satisfies property (HC). Assume further that
FORMULA 
is a group extension
with FORMULA  compact. Let FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  satisfies (HC).

Since compact extensions of unimodular groups
are unimodular, FORMULA  is unimodular. Let FORMULA  be a pair
of functions which satisfy HC1, HC2, and HC3 with respect to
FORMULA . Define FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Then a straightforward computation shows
that FORMULA  satisfies HC1, HC2, and HC3 with
respect to FORMULA .
The second result is slightly more technical.
Lemma 4.4 
Assume that FORMULA  is a unimodular Lie group with finitely many
components and let FORMULA  be a maximal compact subgroup of FORMULA . Let
FORMULA  denote the connected component of FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be a
maximal compact subgroup of FORMULA  such that FORMULA  satisfies
(HC). Then FORMULA  satisfies (HC), too.

First note that we may assume that FORMULA . To see this
observe first that, since FORMULA  is a compact subgroup of FORMULA , we may
assume without loss of generality that FORMULA .
But the maximality of FORMULA  then implies equality. It follows from
this that FORMULA  is a normal subgroup of FORMULA  and since FORMULA  is
connected, it follows that the inclusion FORMULA  induces a group
isomorphism FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be a pair of functions satisfying conditions
HC1–HC3 for FORMULA . It follows from the above remarks that we
can write every element of FORMULA  as a product FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
FORMULA . We then define
FORMULA 
To see that FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are well defined assume that we have two factorizations FORMULA 
with FORMULA . Then FORMULA  with
FORMULA . Since FORMULA  normalizes FORMULA , it follows from
the left and right FORMULA -invariance of FORMULA  that
FORMULA 

A similar computation shows that FORMULA  is well defined.
We are now going to check properties HC1–HC3 for FORMULA .
It follows directly from the definition of FORMULA  and FORMULA  that
they are left invariant under the action of FORMULA . To see right
invariance, we compute for FORMULA :
FORMULA 
So FORMULA  is also right invariant and a similar computation show
that the same is true for FORMULA . Since Haar measure on FORMULA  is
normalized, it follows that FORMULA  and FORMULA . Moreover,
if FORMULA  with FORMULA  we get
FORMULA 

In order to prove the multiplication rule for FORMULA  we use
Weil's formula
FORMULA 
with
respect to normalized Haar measures on FORMULA , and FORMULA  to
compute
FORMULA 

Here the equation (*) follows from the FORMULA -invariance of FORMULA ,
(**) follows from Fubini together with the transformation
FORMULA , and (***) follows from property HC2 for
FORMULA . This completes the proof of HC1 and HC2.
For the proof of HC3 we write FORMULA ,
FORMULA . Since FORMULA , it follows from the FORMULA -invariance of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  that the integrals of FORMULA  over the
FORMULA -cosets coincide. Thus, since FORMULA  is finite, it is
enough to show that FORMULA  for some FORMULA . For
this we first choose a set of representatives FORMULA  for FORMULA  with FORMULA . Then, for FORMULA , we
obtain the inequality
FORMULA 
from which it follows that FORMULA  for all
FORMULA . Thus, if FORMULA  such that FORMULA , then we also
have FORMULA . So let FORMULA  with FORMULA  as above. Then we get
FORMULA 

Since FORMULA  is unimodular, it follows that each summand FORMULA ,
and hence FORMULA .
We are now ready to combine the above results to get
Proposition 4.5 
Let FORMULA  be a locally compact group with finitely many components.
Assume further that FORMULA  has a compact normal subgroup FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is semi-simple with finite center. Then FORMULA 
satisfies BC with trivial coefficients.

Let FORMULA  denote the maximal compact subgroup of FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  is a symmetric space and
therefore has nonpositive sectional curvature. Moreover, if FORMULA  is a
maximal compact subgroup of FORMULA  such that FORMULA , we see
that FORMULA  as a Riemannian manifold. Since FORMULA  acts
isometrically and properly on FORMULA , FORMULA  satisfies the assumptions
of Theorem REF . By Lafforgue's results we also know that
FORMULA  satisfies (HC). Lemmas REF  and
REF  then imply that FORMULA  also satisfies property
(HC). Thus, it follows from the combination of Theorem
REF  with Theorem REF  that FORMULA  satisfies BC
with coefficients in FORMULA .
Using the results on continuous fields of actions as presented in the
previous section, we are now able to prove
Proposition 4.6 
Assume that FORMULA  is a Lie group with finitely many components such
that FORMULA  is reductive, i.e., the Lie algebra FORMULA  of FORMULA  is
a direct sum of two ideals FORMULA  with
FORMULA  semi-simple and FORMULA  abelian. Then FORMULA  satisfies
BC for FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  denote the center of FORMULA . Using Theorem
REF  it is enough to show that FORMULA  satisfies BC with
coefficients in FORMULA , where
the action of FORMULA  on the dual space FORMULA  of FORMULA  is given
via conjugation. Since FORMULA  is central in FORMULA , it follows that this
action factors through an action of the finite group FORMULA .
Moreover, since FORMULA  is a manifold (since FORMULA  is a
compactly generated abelian group), it follows that the quotients of
the orbit-types in FORMULA  are manifolds. From this we easily
obtain a finite decomposition sequence
FORMULA 
of open FORMULA -invariant subsets of FORMULA 
such that the quotients of the differences FORMULA  are homeomorphic to geometric realizations of finite
dimensional simplicial complexes. Moreover, since all stabilizers
for the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  contain FORMULA , which is
semi-simple with trivial center, it follows from a combination of
Proposition REF  with Proposition REF  that
all stabilizers satisfy BC for FORMULA . The result then follows from
Theorem REF .
Since any central extension of a semi-simple group is reductive, we
now get the desired result for general semi-simple groups.
Corollary 4.7 
Let FORMULA  be a semi-simple Lie group with finitely many components and
let
FORMULA 
be a central extension of FORMULA  by
FORMULA . Then FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA . As a consequence
(using Proposition REF ), FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA 
with respect to arbitrary actions of FORMULA  on FORMULA .


The general case
We now want to give a proof of Proposition REF . As
indicated in the first section, we are going to use an induction
argument on the dimension FORMULA . Since any one-dimensional Lie
group with finitely many components is amenable, and since amenable
groups satisfy BC for arbitrary coefficients, the case FORMULA  is clear.
Assume now that FORMULA  is an arbitrary Lie group with finitely many
components. Let FORMULA  denote the connected component of FORMULA . Let FORMULA 
denote the nilradical of FORMULA  and let FORMULA  and FORMULA  denote
the Lie algebras of FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively. If FORMULA ,
then FORMULA  is semi-simple and the result follows from the previous
section. So we may assume that FORMULA .
It is shown in {{cite:2e3e99e9-4d8c-4c9d-b41c-6493561ccef2}} that the subgroup FORMULA  of
FORMULA  corresponding to the subalgebra
FORMULA  of FORMULA  is closed in
FORMULA . Further, if FORMULA  is a Levi section in FORMULA , i.e.,
FORMULA  is a maximal semi-simple subalgebra of FORMULA , then
FORMULA  (e.g., see the discussion in the proof of
{{cite:2e3e99e9-4d8c-4c9d-b41c-6493561ccef2}}). In particular, FORMULA  is semi-simple.
Clearly, FORMULA  is a normal subgroup of FORMULA  and FORMULA  is a finite
extension of a connected abelian Lie group. Let FORMULA  denote the
inverse image of the maximal compact subgroup of FORMULA  in FORMULA . It
follows then from Theorem REF  that FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA 
if and only if FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA . Note that the connected
component of FORMULA  is a compact connected abelian Lie group, hence a
torus group.
Thus, replacing FORMULA  by FORMULA , we may from now on assume that FORMULA  has the
following structure: There exist closed normal subgroups
FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  is a non-trivial connected nilpotent Lie group, FORMULA  is
semi-simple, FORMULA  is a torus group and FORMULA  is finite. Moreover,
by induction we may assume that every almost connected Lie group with
smaller dimension satisfies BC for FORMULA  with respect to arbitrary
actions on FORMULA , or, equivalently (by Proposition REF ),
every central extension by FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA .
It is now useful to recall the following result of Chevalley
(see {{cite:c7698237-8be3-41b5-b951-fdc95abb0269}}):
Proposition 5.1  Let FORMULA 
be a Lie-algebra of endomorphisms of the finite dimensional
real vector space FORMULA . Then
FORMULA  is algebraic (i.e. it corresponds to a real
algebraic subgroup FORMULA )
if and only if there exist subalgebras FORMULA 
of FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
FORMULA  is semi-simple, FORMULA  is the largest ideal
of FORMULA  consisting of nilpotent
endomorphisms, and FORMULA  is an algebraic abelian
subalgebra of FORMULA  consisting of semi-simple
endomorphisms such that FORMULA .

Using Ado's theorem
(see {{cite:c7698237-8be3-41b5-b951-fdc95abb0269}})
and Proposition REF , it follows that the group FORMULA 
considered above is locally algebraic,
i.e., the Lie algebra FORMULA  has a faithful representation
as an algebraic Lie subalgebra into some FORMULA .
Using this structure, the main idea is to apply the Mackey machine to
a suitable abelian subgroup FORMULA  of FORMULA  which is normal in FORMULA . The
fact that FORMULA  is very close to an algebraic group implies that the
action of FORMULA  on the dual FORMULA  of FORMULA  has very good
topological properties, which is precisely what we need to make
everything work. As a first hint that this approach is feasible we
prove:
Lemma 5.2 
Assume that FORMULA  is a Lie group with finitely many components. Let
FORMULA  be a connected closed normal subgroup of FORMULA  such
that FORMULA  is locally algebraic, and such that FORMULA  is compact. Let
FORMULA  denote the nilpotent radical of FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be a
connected abelian normal subgroup of FORMULA . Let FORMULA  denote
the character group of FORMULA  and let FORMULA  act on FORMULA  via
conjugation. Then the following assertions are true:

The orbit space FORMULA  is countably separated,
i.e., all FORMULA -orbits in FORMULA  are locally closed.

If FORMULA  is the stabilizer of some FORMULA  for the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA , then
FORMULA  is amenable.


We first show that it is sufficient to prove the result for the case
FORMULA . Indeed, if we already know that FORMULA  is countably
separated, then we observe that FORMULA  is a topological
FORMULA -space such that FORMULA .
But it is an easy exercise to prove that the quotient space of a
countably separated space by a compact group action is countably
separated.
Assume now that FORMULA  is the stabilizer of some FORMULA  in FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is the
stabilizer in FORMULA . It follows that FORMULA  is a normal subgroup
of FORMULA  such that FORMULA  is compact. If
FORMULA  is amenable, it also follows that
FORMULA , and hence also FORMULA  are
amenable.
So, for the rest of the proof we assume that FORMULA . In the next
step we reduce to the case where FORMULA  is simply connected. For this
let FORMULA  denote the universal covering group of FORMULA . Then
FORMULA  has the same Lie algebra as FORMULA , and therefore it is
locally algebraic. Let FORMULA  denote the quotient map
and let FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is a discrete central subgroup of
FORMULA . Let FORMULA  denote the Lie
algebra of FORMULA  and let FORMULA  denote the connected closed
normal subgroup of FORMULA  corresponding to FORMULA . Then
FORMULA  is a vector subgroup of the nilpotent radical
FORMULA  of FORMULA  and the quotient map FORMULA 
maps FORMULA  surjectively onto FORMULA , i.e., we have FORMULA . In particular, it follows that we may
view FORMULA  as a closed FORMULA -invariant subspace of
FORMULA , and we have
FORMULA  (since the central subgroup
FORMULA  acts trivially on FORMULA ). Thus, if
FORMULA  is countably separated, the same is
true for FORMULA .
We now consider the stabilizers. It follows from the above
considerations that if FORMULA  is the stabilizer of some FORMULA , then FORMULA  is the
stabilizer of FORMULA  in FORMULA . Thus it follows that
FORMULA . Since the
connected component of FORMULA  is mapped onto the
connected component of FORMULA  under the quotient map, it follows
that FORMULA  is a quotient of
FORMULA . Thus, if the latter is
amenable, the same is true for FORMULA .
Thus, in what follows we may assume without loss of generality that
FORMULA  is simply connected. We are then in precisely the same situation
as in the proof of Case (A) of the proof of the Theorem on page 2 of
{{cite:2e3e99e9-4d8c-4c9d-b41c-6493561ccef2}}, and from now on we can follow the line of arguments as
given on pages 2 and 3 of {{cite:2e3e99e9-4d8c-4c9d-b41c-6493561ccef2}} to see that FORMULA  is
countably separated. Moreover, the arguments presented in steps c)
and d) on page 3 of Punkánzsky's book imply that for each
stabilizer FORMULA  the quotient FORMULA  is a
finite extension of an abelian group, and hence is amenable.
Remark 5.3  We should point out that
the result on the stabilizers in Lemma REF  is most
satisfying: Indeed if we know that every almost connected Lie group
with dimension FORMULA  satisfies BC for FORMULA , say, then, by an
easy application of Theorem REF  the same is true for all
Lie groups FORMULA  with FORMULA  and FORMULA  amenable!

Unfortunately, the result on the orbit space FORMULA  is not
sufficient for a direct application of Theorem REF . So
we have to do some extra work to obtain more information on the
structure of FORMULA . To do this
we have to do two steps:

Reduce to cases where the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA 
factors through an algebraic action of some real algebraic group
FORMULA  (or a subgroup of finite index in FORMULA ).

Show that that the topological orbit-spaces of algebraic group actions
on real affine varieties have nice stratifications
as required by Theorem REF .

Note that Pukánszky does the first reduction
for the cocompact subgroup FORMULA  of FORMULA , which allowed us to
draw the conclusions of the previous lemma.
However, with a bit more work we obtain similar conclusion
for FORMULA . The following result is
certainly well-known to the experts, but since we didn't find a direct
reference we included the easy proof.
Lemma 5.4 
Assume that FORMULA  is a Lie group with finitely many components such
that FORMULA  has a connected closed normal subgroup FORMULA  with FORMULA 
semi-simple and FORMULA  a torus group. Let FORMULA  be a finite
dimensional real vector space and let FORMULA  be any
continuous homomorphism. Then the Zariski closure FORMULA  of FORMULA 
is a (reductive) real algebraic group which contains FORMULA  as a
subgroup of finite index.

Let FORMULA  denote
the differential of FORMULA  and let FORMULA  denote the ideal of
FORMULA  corresponding to FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is semi-simple
(or trivial). Since FORMULA  is a semi-simple subgroup of FORMULA 
it is closed in FORMULA . This follows from the fact that every
semi-simple subalgebra of FORMULA  is algebraic
(by Proposition REF ), which implies
that FORMULA  is the connected component of some algebraic linear
subgroup of FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is compact, it
follows that FORMULA  is a closed subgroup of FORMULA , too.
To simplify notation we assume from now on that FORMULA  itself is a
closed subgroup of FORMULA  and that FORMULA  is the
identity map. Let FORMULA  be a Levi
decomposition of FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is abelian and FORMULA  is
semi-simple, it follows that FORMULA 
and FORMULA . Thus
FORMULA  is reductive.
We now show that FORMULA  is an algebraic subalgebra of FORMULA .
By Proposition REF  it suffices to show that
FORMULA  is algebraic and consists of semi-simple elements.
But this will follow if we can show that FORMULA  is compact, and hence a torus group.
Since FORMULA  is finite (since every linear semi-simple group
has finite center), the restriction to FORMULA  of the quotient map
FORMULA  has finite kernel. Since FORMULA , FORMULA  is
compact by assumption, and hence FORMULA  is compact, too.
It follows that the algebraic closure FORMULA  of FORMULA  is a
reductive algebraic group which contains FORMULA  as a subgroup of
finite index. Since every element of FORMULA  fixes the Lie algebra
FORMULA  via the adjoint action, it also normalizes FORMULA .
Therefore, FORMULA  is a reductive algebraic group which
contains FORMULA  as a subgroup of finite index.
We now show that quotients of linear algebraic group actions
on affine varieties have nice stratifications in the sense of
Theorem REF . We are very grateful to Jörg Schürmann
and Peter Slodowy for some valuable comments, which helped us
to replace a previous version of the following result
(which, as was pointed out to us by Jörg Schürmann, contained a gap)
by
Proposition 5.5 
Suppose that FORMULA  is a closed subgroup of finite index
of a Zariski closed subgroup FORMULA  of
FORMULA  and that FORMULA  is a FORMULA -invariant Zariski
closed subset of FORMULA . Then there exists a
stratification
FORMULA 
of open FORMULA -invariant subsets FORMULA  of FORMULA 
such that
FORMULA  admits a continuous and open finite-to-one map
onto a differentiable manifold.

Since every manifold has a triangulation, the above result
really gives what we need to apply Theorem REF .
For the proof we need the following lemma about certain decompositions of
continuous semi-algebraic maps.
Lemma 5.6 
Let FORMULA  be semi-algebraic sets and let FORMULA 
be a continuous semi-algebraic map (see {{cite:df0beb25-abc2-4856-b47a-ae0e3e61e444}} for
the notations).
Then there exists a stratification
FORMULA 
with each FORMULA  open in FORMULA , FORMULA 
is a differentiable manifold and
FORMULA 
is open (in the euclidean topology) for all FORMULA .

Since the image of a semi-algebraic set under a
semi-algebraic map is
semi-algebraic (see {{cite:df0beb25-abc2-4856-b47a-ae0e3e61e444}}),
we may assume without loss of generality that FORMULA .
By {{cite:df0beb25-abc2-4856-b47a-ae0e3e61e444}} there exists a closed
semi-algebraic subset FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
such that FORMULA  is a finite disjoint
union of connected components (combine with {{cite:df0beb25-abc2-4856-b47a-ae0e3e61e444}}) and such that the restriction of FORMULA  to the inverse
image of each component is a projection, hence open.
Thus FORMULA  is open, too.
Indeed, the construction (using {{cite:df0beb25-abc2-4856-b47a-ae0e3e61e444}})
implies that FORMULA  is homeomorphic to
a submanifold of some FORMULA .
Put FORMULA . Since FORMULA , the result
follows by induction.
Remark 5.7 
Let FORMULA  be a real linear algebraic group,
and let FORMULA  be its complexification.
Then it follows from {{cite:2ef8825a-7675-4a19-9cc6-13f072e9749f}} that
each FORMULA -orbit in FORMULA  contains at most finitely many
FORMULA -orbits in FORMULA .

We first note that we may assume without loss of generality
that FORMULA . Indeed, since FORMULA  has finite index in FORMULA ,
every FORMULA -orbit decomposes into finitely many FORMULA -orbits.
Thus, if FORMULA 
is a stratification of FORMULA  for the FORMULA -action
with the required properties,
it is also a stratification for the FORMULA -action with the same properties.
Thus we assume from now on that FORMULA  is a Zariski closed subgroup of
FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  denote the
complexification
of FORMULA . Consider the diagram
FORMULA 
By the theorem of Rosenlicht ({{cite:e109a4fc-4152-4261-be69-ac500ce74a1d}}, but see also
{{cite:06d4ad58-ff69-4ad8-b3ea-9dec1cf37c83}}), there exists a sequence
FORMULA 
of Zariski-closed FORMULA -invariant subsets of
strictly decreasing dimension such that FORMULA 
has closed FORMULA -orbits and the geometric quotient by
FORMULA 
of FORMULA  exists. This means that the
quotient FORMULA 
can be realized as an algebraic set and the quotient map is
also algebraic.
Let FORMULA  be the first of the sets FORMULA 
which has nonempty intersection with FORMULA . Restricting the maps
in the above diagram gives
FORMULA 
The resulting map FORMULA  from FORMULA  to FORMULA  is
an algebraic map, and hence it is a continuous semi-algebraic
map. Thus it follows from Lemma REF  that, if FORMULA  denotes the
image of FORMULA  in FORMULA , then
FORMULA  has a stratification
FORMULA 
such that FORMULA 
is open for all FORMULA , each FORMULA  is open in
FORMULA , and the difference sets FORMULA  are
submanifolds of some FORMULA .
Put FORMULA  for FORMULA . Then FORMULA .
By Remark REF , if we pass through the lower left corner of the
diagram, the corresponding maps FORMULA  are open, finite-to-one, onto the
manifolds FORMULA .
Now replace FORMULA  by the invariant Zariski-closed subset
FORMULA . Repeating the above arguments finitely many
times gives the desired stratification (the procedure stops
after finitely many steps, since any increasing sequence of
Zariski open sets eventually stabilizes).
Using the above results, we are now able to prove
Proposition 5.8 
Suppose that FORMULA  is a Lie group with finitely many components and with
connected closed normal subgroups FORMULA  as in (REF ), i.e., FORMULA  is the
nilradical of FORMULA , FORMULA  is semi-simple and FORMULA  is a torus group.
Let FORMULA  be a connected closed subgroup which is normal
in FORMULA , where FORMULA  denotes the center of FORMULA . Then
FORMULA  decomposes into a countable disjoint union of
open FORMULA -invariant sets FORMULA  such that each FORMULA  has a
stratification
FORMULA 
(where FORMULA  may depend on FORMULA )
of open FORMULA -invariant subsets of FORMULA ,
and continuous open surjections
FORMULA 
such
that each FORMULA  is a differentiable manifold and inverse images of
points in FORMULA  are finite unions of FORMULA -orbits in FORMULA  for
all FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  denote the ideal of FORMULA  corresponding to FORMULA .
Then we may identify FORMULA  with a closed FORMULA -stable subset
of FORMULA  of the form FORMULA  with FORMULA  being a vector
subgroup of FORMULA  and FORMULA  a finitely generated free abelian
group. Note that FORMULA  can be identified with the dual of the maximal
compact subgroup in FORMULA , and therefore we can decompose FORMULA  into a
disjoint union of FORMULA -orbits, which are all finite since FORMULA  acts
trivially on FORMULA . It then follows that FORMULA  can be
decomposed into a disjoint union of FORMULA -invariant sets of the form
FORMULA  with FORMULA  finite.
The action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is given via the coadjoint
representation FORMULA . Since
FORMULA , it follows that this representation factors
through a representation of FORMULA . Thus it follows from the general
assumptions on FORMULA  and Lemma REF  that the algebraic
closure FORMULA  of FORMULA  in FORMULA  is a
reductive algebraic group which contains the image of
FORMULA  as a subgroup of finite index. Since the
FORMULA -stable sets of the form FORMULA  of the previous paragraph
are closed algebraic subvarieties of FORMULA , it follows that
these sets are also invariant under the action of the Zariski
closure FORMULA  of FORMULA . Thus it follows from
Proposition REF  that for each such set we obtain a
stratification
FORMULA 
with the required properties.
We are now ready for the final step:
By the discussion at the beginning of this section we may assume
without loss of generality that FORMULA  is as in (REF ),
i.e., we have connected closed normal subgroups
FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  is a
nontrivial nilpotent group FORMULA  is semi-simple and FORMULA  is a
torus group. For the induction step we have to show that every
central extension
FORMULA 
satisfies BC for FORMULA . Let
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  denote the inverse images of
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  in FORMULA . Then the sequence of normal
subgroups
FORMULA 
has
the same general properties as the sequence FORMULA , in particular, FORMULA  is the nilradical of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  is locally algebraic. Let FORMULA  denote the
central copy of FORMULA  in FORMULA  coming from the given central
extension. We now divide the proof into the following cases:

The center FORMULA  of FORMULA  has dimension
greater or equal to two.

FORMULA .

We start with Case C(1): By Theorem REF  (and the discussion
following that theorem) it suffices to show that FORMULA  satisfies
BC with coefficients in FORMULA  where the action of
FORMULA  on FORMULA  is given by conjugation. By Theorem
REF  it suffices to show that all stabilizers
FORMULA  satisfy BC for FORMULA  and that
FORMULA  has a nice stratification. While the latter follows
from Proposition REF , the requirement on the stabilizers
follows from Lemma REF , Remark REF , and the
induction assumption since
FORMULA 
This finishes
the proof in Case C(1).
For the proof of Case C(2) we have to do some more reduction steps in
order to use the same line of arguments as in C(1). For this it is
useful to consider the following two subcases:

If FORMULA  denotes the inverse image of the center
FORMULA  of FORMULA  in FORMULA , then FORMULA .

FORMULA .

In Case (2)a we consider the normal subgroup FORMULA  of FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  is a connected two-step nilpotent Lie group with
one-dimensional center FORMULA , and therefore a Heisenberg group. It
follows that FORMULA  can be written as the direct sum
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  acts trivially on
FORMULA , it follows that the decomposition action of FORMULA 
on FORMULA  induces an action on each fibre FORMULA , and,
by Theorem REF  together with Proposition REF ,
it follows that FORMULA  satisfies BC with coefficients in FORMULA  if
FORMULA  satisfies BC with coefficients in FORMULA  for
each FORMULA . If FORMULA , we get
FORMULA , and the desired result follows from the
induction assumption and the fact that FORMULA .
So we only have to deal with the case FORMULA , where we have to deal
with the fibre FORMULA . But
here we are exactly in the same situation as in the proof of Case C(1),
since the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  factors through an
action of FORMULA  and all stabilizers of the characters of FORMULA  have
dimension strictly smaller than FORMULA .
We have to work a bit more for the Proof of Case (2)b. Here we put
FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is a connected abelian subgroup of
FORMULA  and it follows from Lemma REF , Remark
REF , the fact that FORMULA 
and the induction assumption that
all stabilizers for the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  satisfy
BC for FORMULA .
Again we study the structure of the orbit space FORMULA .
For each FORMULA  we define
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA 
is central in FORMULA , it follows that FORMULA  acts trivially on
FORMULA , and hence that FORMULA  is
FORMULA -invariant for all FORMULA . Since
FORMULA  is discrete, we may write
FORMULA 
with fiberwise action of
FORMULA . Thus by continuity of BC it suffices to deal with the
single fibers. For FORMULA  we are looking at the action of
FORMULA  on FORMULA , and
since FORMULA  is a central subgroup of FORMULA  we may again argue precisely
as in the proof of Case C(1) to see that FORMULA  satisfies BC for
FORMULA .
In order to deal with the other fibers we are now going to show that
FORMULA  acts transitively on FORMULA  for each nontrivial
character FORMULA . It follows then directly from
Corollary REF  that FORMULA  satisfies BC for
FORMULA . In fact, Lemma REF  below
shows that FORMULA  already acts transitively on FORMULA 
for FORMULA  and the result will follow from that lemma.
The following lemma is certainly well known to the experts on the
representation theory of nilpotent groups. For the readers convenience
we give the elementary proof.
Lemma 5.9 
Assume that FORMULA  is a connected nilpotent Lie group with
one-dimensional center FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be a closed connected
abelian normal subgroup of FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Let FORMULA  and let
FORMULA . Then FORMULA 
acts transitively on FORMULA  by conjugation.

We may assume without loss of generality that FORMULA  is simply
connected. In fact, if this is not the case, we pass to the
universal covering group FORMULA  of FORMULA  and the universal
covering FORMULA  of FORMULA  and observe that
there exists a discrete subgroup FORMULA 
such that FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and
FORMULA  can then be (equivariantly) identified with
FORMULA  for all FORMULA .
Let FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  denote the Lie algebras of
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively. Since FORMULA  is simply connected, we
can write
FORMULA 
with multiplication given by the
Campbell-Hausdorff formula. In particular, if FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA , since it
follows from the assumption that FORMULA  that
FORMULA  and all commutators with
FORMULA  vanish. In particular, if we conjugate FORMULA  by
FORMULA  we get the formula
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA .
Assume now that FORMULA  and let FORMULA .
We claim that we can find a basis FORMULA  of
FORMULA  and elements FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . Indeed this follows from an easy
Schmidt-orthogonalization procedure: Consider the bilinear form
FORMULA 
Choose FORMULA . Then there exists FORMULA 
with FORMULA  (since FORMULA  is not central), and hence we may
assume that FORMULA . Assume now that we have chosen FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA , with the desired
properties. Choose FORMULA  not in the span of FORMULA  and FORMULA  with FORMULA . Then it is easy
to check that FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Now we identify FORMULA  with FORMULA  (via FORMULA ) and FORMULA 
with FORMULA . The conjugation action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is
then transferred to the coadjoint action FORMULA . If FORMULA  is a dual basis for the basis FORMULA  of
FORMULA , the result will follow if we can show that
FORMULA 
for all
FORMULA . By rescaling we may assume that FORMULA .
But for FORMULA  we can compute
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is
central in FORMULA  it follows that
FORMULA  for all FORMULA . Thus
FORMULA 

Relations to the FORMULA -theory of the maximal compact subgroup
In this section we want to describe the relations between the
FORMULA -theory of FORMULA  and the FORMULA -theory of FORMULA , where FORMULA 
denotes the maximal compact subgroup of the almost connected group
FORMULA  (we chose the letter FORMULA  to avoid confusion). We should mention
that all results presented here (accept the conclusions drawn out of
our main theorem) are well known, but since they have important impact
on our results, we found it useful to give at least a brief report.
The main references for these results are {{cite:cbfe4b43-22ef-4ab2-8789-7bdf0d2db755}}, {{cite:fa76f513-69a0-4bf0-93f9-1d1dbffd6878}}, and we
refer especially to {{cite:cbfe4b43-22ef-4ab2-8789-7bdf0d2db755}} for a more geometric discussion of
some the results presented in this section.
If FORMULA  and FORMULA  are as above, it follows from work of Abels (see
{{cite:6bbd79be-249d-4641-9f0a-ec031dc72462}}) that FORMULA  is a universal proper FORMULA -space. Thus we have
FORMULA 
where the second isomorphism follows from
{{cite:af5442ae-d4b5-4753-899e-e8e7839c2478}}. Also by the work of Abels
{{cite:6bbd79be-249d-4641-9f0a-ec031dc72462}}, FORMULA  is a Riemannian manifold which is FORMULA -equivariantly
diffeomorphic to the tangent space FORMULA  equipped with the
adjoint action of FORMULA  on FORMULA . It follows then from Kasparov's work in
{{cite:fa76f513-69a0-4bf0-93f9-1d1dbffd6878}} (see {{cite:9569cc5f-21a8-436a-a084-c9db7025eba1}} for a more extensive
discussion) that tensoring with FORMULA  gives a natural isomorphism
FORMULA 
and by Kasparov's Bott-periodicity theorem (see
{{cite:fa76f513-69a0-4bf0-93f9-1d1dbffd6878}}) we know that FORMULA , equipped
with the diagonal action, is FORMULA -equivalent to FORMULA  (but see also
the discussion below). Thus we obtain the following chain of
isomorphisms
FORMULA 

where the last isomorphism follows from the Green-Julg theorem.
Hence, as a direct consequence of Theorem REF  we can
deduce
Theorem 6.1 
Assume that FORMULA  is an almost connected (second countable) group with
maximal compact subgroup FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the algebra of
compact operators on the separable Hilbert space FORMULA  equipped with
any action of FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is naturally
isomorphic to FORMULA .

By Kasparov's Bott-periodicity theorem (see {{cite:fa76f513-69a0-4bf0-93f9-1d1dbffd6878}}) it
follows that FORMULA  is FORMULA -equivalent to the graded complex
Clifford algebra FORMULA  (with respect to a compatible inner product
on FORMULA ), equipped with the action of FORMULA  induced by the given action
on FORMULA . So we can replace FORMULA  by the graded FORMULA -algebra
FORMULA , but then we have to use graded FORMULA -theory!
Let us look a bit closer to the implications of this Bott-periodicity
theorem. Assume for the moment that FORMULA  is even dimensional and that
the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  preserves a given orientation of FORMULA , i.e.,
the action factors through a homomorphism FORMULA . We
have a central extension
FORMULA 
of FORMULA , where
FORMULA  denotes the group of complex spinors (e.g.
see {{cite:86e1ba8a-d903-49c9-ba80-fe8ab2fb6341}}). The corresponding action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is given
by the homomorphism
FORMULA 
Now choose a fixed
orthonormal base FORMULA  of FORMULA . Then the grading of
FORMULA  is given by conjugation with the symmetry FORMULA . One can show that, up to a sign, FORMULA  does not
depend on the choice of this basis, and the sign only depends on the
orientation of the basis. In particular, FORMULA  is invariant under
conjugation with elements in FORMULA . From this it follows that
the graded FORMULA -algebra FORMULA  is FORMULA -equivariantly Morita equivalent
to the trivially graded FORMULA -algebra FORMULA  – a Morita equivalence is
given by the module FORMULA  with given FORMULA -action and grading
automorphism given by left multiplication with FORMULA . Moreover, since
FORMULA  is even, FORMULA  is isomorphic to the simple matrix
algebra FORMULA .
Assume now that FORMULA  is odd. Then, replacing FORMULA  by
FORMULA  (with trivial action of FORMULA  on FORMULA ) we get
FORMULA 
Moreover, if
the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is orientation preserving, the same is
true for the resulting action of FORMULA  on FORMULA , which we
identify with the tangent space at FORMULA  in the group FORMULA .
Hence, modulo a dimension shift, we can use the above considerations
also for this case. Thus, as a consequence of Theorem
REF  we obtain
Theorem 6.2 
Assume that FORMULA  is an almost connected group with maximal compact
subgroup FORMULA  such that the adjoint action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is
orientation preserving. Then there are natural isomorphisms
FORMULA 
if FORMULA  is even and
FORMULA 
if FORMULA  is odd. Here all
algebras are trivially graded!

Perhaps, the above result has its most satisfying formulation if
translated into the language of twisted group algebras. For this let
FORMULA  denote a representative of the Mackey obstruction
for the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  (see the discussion preceding Lemma
REF ). Then FORMULA  is isomorphic to
FORMULA , where FORMULA  denotes the reduced
twisted group algebra FORMULA  (e.g., see {{cite:746b8f20-5036-4789-a66f-ab4a52d15a50}}). Recall that FORMULA  can be defined either as the
reduced twisted crossed product FORMULA  with
respect to the twisted action FORMULA  (which, by Lemma
REF , is Morita equivalent to the given action on FORMULA ), or
as the completion of FORMULA , where FORMULA  acts
on FORMULA  by the twisted convolution
FORMULA 
Up to isomorphism, FORMULA  only depends on the
class FORMULA . Conversely, given any cocycle, the
representation FORMULA  given by
FORMULA 
determines an action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  with Mackey obstruction
represented by FORMULA .
Note that the Mackey obstruction for the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is
given by the restriction of FORMULA  to FORMULA  and the obstruction for the
action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  (if FORMULA  is even) is
given by the pull-back, say FORMULA , to FORMULA  of a cocycle representing
the central extension
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  (diagonal action), where
FORMULA 
is the real group of spinors,
the cocycle FORMULA  can be chosen to take values in the subgroup
FORMULA , and therefore FORMULA . Note that FORMULA  is
trivial if and only if the homomorphism FORMULA 
factorizes through FORMULA  (i.e., if and only if FORMULA  carries a
FORMULA -invariant FORMULA -structure). If FORMULA  is odd, we may
define FORMULA  in the same way as above, noticing that this cocycle is
equivalent to the pull back of (a cocycle representing) the extension
FORMULA 
which
follows from the fact that FORMULA  acts trivially on FORMULA ! Since the
Mackey obstruction of a tensor product of actions is the product of
the Mackey obstructions of the factors, we obtain
Theorem 6.3 
Assume that FORMULA  is an almost connected group with maximal compact
subgroup FORMULA  such that the adjoint action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is
orientation preserving. Let FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be any cocycle on FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
In particular, in the special case where
FORMULA  is trivial, we obtain an isomorphism
FORMULA 

Again, FORMULA  is trivial if and only if FORMULA  carries a FORMULA -invariant
FORMULA -structure. In general, since FORMULA  is the
quotient of the central extension FORMULA  of FORMULA  by FORMULA 
corresponding to the character FORMULA  of FORMULA , it follows that
FORMULA  is a direct sum of (possibly infinitely many)
matrix algebras. Thus as a direct corollary of the above result we
obtain:
Corollary 6.4 
Assume that FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  are as in Theorem REF .
Then FORMULA  is isomorphic to a free
abelian group in at most countably many generators and
FORMULA .

This result has interesting consequence towards the question of
existence of square integrable representations of connected unimodular
Lie groups. In fact, combining the above corollary with {{cite:d1ab7eeb-43d1-4bfd-9e59-c1a29ab4da6f}} gives:
Corollary 6.5 (cf {{cite:d1ab7eeb-43d1-4bfd-9e59-c1a29ab4da6f}}) 
Let FORMULA  be a connected unimodular Lie group. Then all
square-integrable factor representations of FORMULA  are type I.
Moreover, FORMULA  has no square-integrable factor representations if
FORMULA  is odd, where FORMULA  denotes the maximal compact subgroup
of FORMULA .

We refer to {{cite:d1ab7eeb-43d1-4bfd-9e59-c1a29ab4da6f}} for more detailed discussions on this kind of
applications of the positive solution of the Connes-Kasparov
conjecture. Note that Theorem REF  and Corollary
REF  do not hold in general without the assumption that
the action of FORMULA  on FORMULA  is orientation preserving. In fact an
easy six-term-sequence argument shows that it cannot hold for the
group FORMULA , where FORMULA  acts on FORMULA  by reflection
through 0.
