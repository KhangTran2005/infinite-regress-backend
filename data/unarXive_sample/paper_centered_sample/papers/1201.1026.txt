Polynomials in algebraic analysisPiotr Multarzy≈ÑskiFaculty of Mathematics and Information ScienceWarsaw University of Technology 00-661 Warsaw, Pl. Politechniki 1, Polande-mail: multarz@mini.pw.edu.plThe concept of polynomials in the sense of algebraic analysis, for a single right invertible linear operator, was introduced and studied originally by D. Przeworska-Rolewicz {{cite:628c6b4b-c943-4f9e-a0ef-56d2a5fdfd4f}}. One of the elegant results corresponding with that notion is a purely algebraic version of the Taylor formula, being a generalization of its usual counterpart, well known for functions of one variable.
In quantum calculus there are some specific discrete derivations analyzed, which are right invertible linear operators {{cite:124a6bab-1a4f-4a72-b17a-62652ccd1763}}. Hence, with such quantum derivations one can associate the corresponding concept of algebraic polynomials and consequently the quantum calculus version of Taylor formula {{cite:bd01c6dd-ecc1-41ad-8d85-f1ab8cd303d7}}. In the present paper we define and analyze, in the sense of algebraic analysis, polynomials corresponding with a given family of right invertible operators. Within this approach we generalize the usual polynomials of several variables.

Introduction
Algebraic analysis, founded and developed by D. Przeworska-Rolewicz {{cite:628c6b4b-c943-4f9e-a0ef-56d2a5fdfd4f}},
is an algebra-based theory unifying many different generalizations of derivatives and integrals, not necessarily continuous. The main concepts of this algebraic formulation are right invertible linear operators, their right inverses and associated initial operators.
Right invertible operators are considered to be algebraic counterparts of derivatives and their right inverses together with initial operators correspond with the idea of integration. Amongst many examples one can interpret in terms of algebraic analysis there are e.g. usual differential and integral calculus, generalized differential calculus in rings {{cite:ba3814f4-9c2f-45b2-ba65-e828ec602d0e}} and many different quantum calculi {{cite:124a6bab-1a4f-4a72-b17a-62652ccd1763}}, {{cite:4b681fc0-7269-4c64-b9f5-8d9400150ed7}}, {{cite:3fa8499d-5656-4d8b-938e-82d59d90b56a}}, {{cite:8428a26f-fe46-486f-9a9b-4dfbfc49cbcf}}. With a fixed right invertible operator FORMULA , defined in a linear space FORMULA , one can naturally associate the concept of FORMULA -polynomials and algebraically formulate Taylor formula {{cite:628c6b4b-c943-4f9e-a0ef-56d2a5fdfd4f}}, {{cite:bd01c6dd-ecc1-41ad-8d85-f1ab8cd303d7}}. However, the FORMULA -polynomials, Taylor formula, definite integrals associated with a single right invertible operator FORMULA  constitute the algebraic counterparts corresponding with mathematical analysis for functions of one variable. Therefore, there is a natural need to extend algebraic analysis in order to algebraically generalize ideas from mathematical analysis for functions of many variables. To begin this direction,
we replace a single operator FORMULA  by a fixed family FORMULA  of right invertible operators and study the corresponding FORMULA -polynomials.

Preliminaries
Let FORMULA  be a linear space over a field FORMULA  and FORMULA 
be the family of all linear mappings FORMULA , for any
FORMULA , FORMULA  - linear subspaces of FORMULA . We shall use the notation
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  for the domain,
codomain and image of FORMULA , correspondingly.
Throughout this paper we use the notation
FORMULA 
Whenever FORMULA , we shall write
FORMULA , for FORMULA , and additionally
FORMULA .
By the space of constants for FORMULA  we shall mean the family
FORMULA 
For any FORMULA  and FORMULA , we assume the
notation
FORMULA 
Evidently, for any FORMULA 
there is
FORMULA 
whenever FORMULA .
Proposition 2.1 
Let FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA 
for FORMULA . Then, any elements FORMULA , FORMULA , are linearly independent.

Consider a linear combination FORMULA 
and suppose that FORMULA  for some coefficients FORMULA . Hence we obtain the sequence of
equations: FORMULA , for FORMULA . Step by step, from these
equations we compute FORMULA .
Let us define
FORMULA 
i.e. each element
FORMULA  is considered to be a surjective mapping (onto its
codomain). Thus, FORMULA  consists of all right invertible
elements.
Definition 2.2 
An operator FORMULA  is said to be a right inverse of
FORMULA  if FORMULA  and FORMULA .
By FORMULA  we denote the family of all right inverses of FORMULA .

In fact, FORMULA  is a nonempty family, since for each FORMULA  we can select an element FORMULA  and define
FORMULA  such that FORMULA .
The fundamental role in the calculus of right invertible operators
play the so-called initial operators, projecting the domains of
linear operators onto the corresponding space of their constants.
Definition 2.3 
Any operator FORMULA , such that FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  is said to be an initial operator induced
by FORMULA . We say that an initial operator FORMULA 
corresponds to a right inverse FORMULA  whenever FORMULA  or
equivalently if
FORMULA 
The family of all initial operators induced by FORMULA  will be denoted
by FORMULA .

The families FORMULA  and FORMULA  uniquely determine each
other. Indeed, formula (REF ) characterizes initial operators
by means of right inverses, whereas formula
FORMULA 
which is independent of FORMULA , characterizes right inverses by means
of initial operators. Both families FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are fully characterized by formulae
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are fixed
arbitrarily.

Let us illustrate the above concepts with two basic examples.
Example 2.4  FORMULA  - the linear space of all
functions, FORMULA  - usual derivative, i.e.
FORMULA , with FORMULA  consisting of all differentiable functions.
Then, for an arbitrarily fixed FORMULA , by formula
FORMULA  one can define a right inverse FORMULA  and the initial operator FORMULA  corresponding to
FORMULA  is given by FORMULA .

Example 2.5  FORMULA  - the linear space of all sequences, FORMULA  - difference operator, i.e.
FORMULA , for FORMULA . A right inverse FORMULA  is defined by the formulae FORMULA  and FORMULA  while
FORMULA  defines the initial operator FORMULA  corresponding to FORMULA .

An immediate consequence of Definition REF , for an
invertible operator FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA , is that
FORMULA . Therefore, the nontrivial initial operators do
exist only for operators which are right invertible but not
invertible. The family of all such operators is then
FORMULA 
Proposition 2.6 (Taylor Formula) 
Suppose FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be an initial
operator corresponding to FORMULA . Then the operator
identity
FORMULA 
holds on FORMULA , for FORMULA .

(Induction) See Ref.{{cite:628c6b4b-c943-4f9e-a0ef-56d2a5fdfd4f}}.

Equivalent identity, expressed as
FORMULA 
for FORMULA  and FORMULA , is an algebraic
counterpart of the Taylor expansion formula, commonly known in
mathematical analysis, for functions of one variable. The first component of formula (REF )
reflects the polynomial part while the second one can be viewed as
the corresponding remainder.
Example 2.7 To clearly demonstrate the resemblance of formula (REF )
with the commonly used Taylor expression, we take FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA 
as in Example REF . Since there are many forms of the
remainders in use, it is more interesting to calculate the polynomial
part, which gives the well known result
FORMULA ,
for any function FORMULA .

Proposition 2.8 
Let FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is not a
nilpotent operator.

Suppose that FORMULA  and FORMULA , for some FORMULA .
Then FORMULA , a contradiction.
Proposition 2.9 
If FORMULA , then FORMULA , for any
FORMULA .

The relation FORMULA  is straightforward. Let
FORMULA  and FORMULA  be arbitrarily chosen elements.
Then, for any FORMULA , there is FORMULA .

In algebraic analysis, with any right invertible operator FORMULA  we
associate the following concept of FORMULA -polynomials.
Definition 2.10 
If FORMULA , then any element FORMULA  is said
to be a FORMULA -polynomial of degree m, i.e. FORMULA , for
FORMULA . We assign degree FORMULA  to the zero polynomial
FORMULA .

Proposition 2.11 
If FORMULA  and FORMULA , then for any
FORMULA -polynomial FORMULA  there exist elements FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 

By formula (REF ) we can write the
identity FORMULA  since FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Then we define elements FORMULA ,
FORMULA , which ends the proof.
Definition 2.12  Let FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Then, any element FORMULA , for FORMULA , is said to
be an FORMULA -homogeneous FORMULA -polynomial (or FORMULA -monomial) of degree
FORMULA .

Thus, any FORMULA -polynomial FORMULA , of degree FORMULA , is a sum of linearly independent FORMULA -homogeneous elements
FORMULA , FORMULA . The linear space of all FORMULA -polynomials
is then
FORMULA 
whereas
FORMULA 
is the linear space of all FORMULA -polynomials of degree at most
FORMULA .
Let us fix a basis
FORMULA 
of the linear space FORMULA , FORMULA , and define
FORMULA 
for FORMULA . Then
FORMULA 
Proposition 2.13 
For an arbitrary right inverse FORMULA , the family
FORMULA  is the basis of
the linear space FORMULA . Naturally, FORMULA  forms the basis of the linear space FORMULA , for
FORMULA .

Let FORMULA ,
FORMULA  and FORMULA  be finite subsets for
FORMULA . Assume FORMULA  and calculate FORMULA , which implies FORMULA , for all FORMULA . Hence FORMULA  and analogously we get FORMULA , which implies FORMULA , for
all FORMULA . Similarly we prove that FORMULA , for all
FORMULA , FORMULA . Now, let FORMULA  be a
polynomial of degree FORMULA . Then, on the
strength of Proposition REF , we can write
FORMULA , for some elements FORMULA . In turn, each element FORMULA  can be expressed as a linear
combination FORMULA , for some finite
subset of indices FORMULA . Hence we obtain
FORMULA .
With a right inverse FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , we shall associate the linearly independent family
FORMULA  forming a basis of the
linear space of FORMULA -homogeneous FORMULA -polynomials
FORMULA 
(independent of the choice of FORMULA ) of dimension
FORMULA 
being a linear subspace of FORMULA . Then, on the strength of
Proposition REF , the linear space FORMULA  is a direct
sum
FORMULA 
Corollary 2.14 If FORMULA , the following formula holds
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA .

Naturally, one can extend formula (REF ) and define
FORMULA 
which is both FORMULA - and FORMULA -invariant subspace of FORMULA , i.e.
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Thus, FORMULA  turns out to be simultaneously FORMULA - and FORMULA -invariant
linear subspace of FORMULA , since it can be decomposed as the following
direct sum
FORMULA 
Since FORMULA  is a linear subspace of FORMULA , there exists
(not uniquely) another linear subspace FORMULA  of FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
Then, every linear mapping FORMULA  can be
decomposed as the direct sum
FORMULA 
of two restrictions FORMULA  and
FORMULA , i.e. for any FORMULA  and FORMULA  there is FORMULA . In
particular, the mappings FORMULA , FORMULA 
can be decomposed as direct sums FORMULA ,
FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
which allows for the decomposition of the initial operator FORMULA 
corresponding to  FORMULA
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
Proposition 2.15 Let FORMULA , FORMULA  be any right
inverses and FORMULA  be the initial operators
corresponding to FORMULA  and FORMULA , respectively. Then
FORMULA  and FORMULA  corresponds to FORMULA .

FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
FORMULA 

The last results allow one to combine right inverses and initial
operators as direct sums of independent components.

FORMULA -polynomials
Originally, the main concepts of algebraic analysis have been defined for a single right invertible operator FORMULA . Such an approach one can recognize as an algebraic generalization of mathematical analysis dedicated to functions of one variable.
In this section we propose to replace a single FORMULA  by a nonempty family FORMULA  and extend the notion of a polynomial in order to relate it with mathematical analysis of many variables. Since mathematical analysis of many variables forms a groundwork for differential geometry, there is a hope that the corresponding geometric ideas can also be studied in terms of algebraic analysis.
By FORMULA  and FORMULA  we shall denote the families of all right inverses and all initial operators defined for a single FORMULA , correspondingly. This we understand as FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , for any FORMULA  and FORMULA .
If the additional condition FORMULA  is fulfilled, we say that FORMULA  corresponds to FORMULA .
Definition 3.1 
For any family FORMULA  we define
FORMULA 
which is called the family of FORMULA -constants.
In the trivial case, i.e. when FORMULA , we assume
FORMULA 

Obviously, for any two families FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
On the strength of formula (REF ) we notice that
FORMULA 
Definition 3.2 A family FORMULA  separates elements of FORMULA  if
for any two different elements FORMULA  there exists FORMULA  such that FORMULA .

In particular, FORMULA  separates elements of FORMULA  if there is an invertible element FORMULA .
If a family FORMULA  separates elements of FORMULA , then FORMULA  becomes trivial, i.e. FORMULA .
In the sequel we shall assume FORMULA  to be a family of right invertible operators which does not separate elements of FORMULA , i.e. FORMULA . In particular, from this assumption we notice that
FORMULA  and any element FORMULA  is right invertible but not invertible, i.e. FORMULA .
Definition 3.3 
An initial operator for FORMULA  is any map FORMULA , satisfying FORMULA  and FORMULA . By FORMULA  we shall denote the family of all initial operators for FORMULA .

To compare two notations, notice that FORMULA , when FORMULA .

The immediate consequence of the above definition is that nontrivial initial operators for FORMULA  do exist only if
FORMULA 
Therefore, in the sequel we shall assume condition (REF ) to be fulfiled.
Definition 3.4 Let FORMULA , FORMULA . We say that an initial operator FORMULA  corresponds with a family FORMULA  of right inverses FORMULA , if FORMULA , for any FORMULA .

Proposition 3.5 Let FORMULA  and FORMULA . Then, for any initial operator FORMULA , the operator FORMULA  is also a right inverse of FORMULA .

Indeed, FORMULA .

In the particular case when FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , the right inverse FORMULA  is independent of FORMULA  (compare Ref. {{cite:628c6b4b-c943-4f9e-a0ef-56d2a5fdfd4f}}). However, if FORMULA  consists of more than one element, the operator FORMULA  depends on FORMULA , in general.
Proposition 3.6 For any family FORMULA , FORMULA , an initial operator FORMULA  corresponds with the family FORMULA .

Indeed, FORMULA , for any FORMULA .
Definition 3.7 The linear subspace of FORMULA  defined as
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA , is called the space of FORMULA -polynomials of degree at most FORMULA . For the sake of convenience we assume
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA , in case when FORMULA ,.

One can easily notice that
FORMULA 
Thus, we can build the linear subspace of  FORMULA
FORMULA 
called the linear space of all FORMULA -polynomials.
Let us notice that formula (REF ) can be generalized as follows
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA .
Consequently, for any two nonempty families FORMULA , we get the generalization of formula (REF ), namely
FORMULA 
If a family FORMULA  separates elements of FORMULA , we obtain FORMULA . Therefore, we shall be interested with families FORMULA  which do not separate elements of FORMULA .
Definition 3.8 
Define the families FORMULA  and
FORMULA 
for any FORMULA . Then, any element FORMULA  is said to be a FORMULA -polynomial of degree FORMULA . By definition, we shall assume FORMULA .

Evidently, in case when FORMULA  separates elements of FORMULA , there are no nontrivial FORMULA -polynomials, i.e. FORMULA , for any FORMULA . On the strength of formula (REF ) and Definition (REF ) we can notice that
FORMULA 
i.e. all nonzero elements of FORMULA  are considered to be of degree 0, if FORMULA .
Definition 3.9 
Let FORMULA  be a family which does not separate elements of FORMULA . Then, FORMULA  is said to be effective if there extists a family, so-called FORMULA -proper family, FORMULA  of right inverses FORMULA , FORMULA , such that for any FORMULA , FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
By definition we assume that the empty family FORMULA  is effective.

Proposition 3.10 Any subfamily FORMULA  of an effective family FORMULA  is effective as well.

By definition, the empty subfamily FORMULA  is effective.
Now, let
FORMULA  and FORMULA  be an arbitrary subfamily. Since an effective family FORMULA  does not separate elements of FORMULA , the more so does not its subfamily FORMULA . With subfamilies FORMULA  we can associate the family FORMULA . Then, one can easily verify that FORMULA  and by formula (REF ), for any FORMULA , we obtain
FORMULA 
Proposition 3.11 If FORMULA  is a nonempty effective family which does not separate points of FORMULA , then FORMULA , for any FORMULA .

Since FORMULA  does not separate points of FORMULA , we get FORMULA . Now, on the strength of Definition (REF ), we can take an arbitrary FORMULA , FORMULA , and by formula (REF ) we obtain
FORMULA . Hence FORMULA , for any FORMULA .

Below we formulate the concept of a weakly effective family FORMULA , which is also sufficient to produce nonempty sets of FORMULA -polynomials of degree FORMULA .
Definition 3.12 Let FORMULA  and FORMULA .
We say that FORMULA  is a regular element of FORMULA  (or FORMULA -regular, for short) if there exists a right inverse FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
A right inverse FORMULA  is said to be FORMULA -proper if condition (REF ) is fulfilled.

Definition 3.13 A family FORMULA  is said to be weakly effective if there exists a FORMULA -regular element FORMULA .

Evidently, for any FORMULA , the family FORMULA  is weakly effective. Moreover, in such a case any element FORMULA  is a FORMULA -proper right inverse.
Indeed, in this case FORMULA  and formula (REF ) is fulfilled trivially (by logic).
Proposition 3.14 Suppose FORMULA  is a weakly effective family which does not separate elements of FORMULA . Then
FORMULA , for any FORMULA .

Since family FORMULA  does not separate elements of FORMULA , we get FORMULA 
and consequently FORMULA .
Now, let FORMULA  be a regular element of FORMULA  and FORMULA  be its FORMULA -proper right inverse. This means that, for any FORMULA  and FORMULA , there is FORMULA , for any FORMULA .
On the other hand, FORMULA  and FORMULA , which means that
FORMULA , for FORMULA  and FORMULA .

The following statement shows the hierarchy relation between the two effectivity concepts, which motivates the term "weakly".
Proposition 3.15 Any nonempty effective family FORMULA  is weakly effective.

Let FORMULA  be a nonempty effective family. A singleton FORMULA  is evidently an efective family. Let us assume now that
FORMULA , FORMULA , and FORMULA .
Since FORMULA , by formula (REF ),
for FORMULA , we obtain
FORMULA . The last equality can be easily extended to
FORMULA .
Finally, because FORMULA , we can write FORMULA .
Below we present two examples showing some effective families FORMULA  and their FORMULA -polynomials.
In both examples use the notation FORMULA  and FORMULA , for any
FORMULA .
Example 3.16 Let FORMULA  be the linear space of functions FORMULA , for a fixed FORMULA , and let FORMULA  be the family of the generalized derivations {{cite:ba3814f4-9c2f-45b2-ba65-e828ec602d0e}}, i.e. FORMULA , FORMULA .
The elements of FORMULA  are of the form FORMULA  and consequently
FORMULA  consists of functions FORMULA ,
where FORMULA  and FORMULA . Hence, FORMULA  and the family FORMULA  does not separate elements of FORMULA . The following formula defines a FORMULA -proper family of right inverses FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
for FORMULA . Hence, the family FORMULA  is effective. Since FORMULA , the polynomials of degree zero are simply functions FORMULA , where FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In turn, if we apply formula (REF ) to FORMULA , we can obtain FORMULA -polynomials of higher degrees. For example FORMULA  are FORMULA -polynomials of degree 1, whereas FORMULA  or FORMULA , FORMULA , are FORMULA -polynomials of degree 2.

Example 3.17 Let FORMULA  be a linear space of functions FORMULA , for a fixed FORMULA ,
FORMULA , where FORMULA  and let us take the right inverses FORMULA  defined by FORMULA , FORMULA , for FORMULA . One can check that FORMULA  is a FORMULA -proper family, which means that the family FORMULA  of partial difference operators is effective.
Evidently, the space FORMULA  consists of all constant functions, hence the elements of FORMULA  are nonzero constant functions. In turn, functions FORMULA , FORMULA , are the examples of FORMULA -polynomials of degree 1, whereas functions FORMULA  or FORMULA  are FORMULA -polynomials of degree 2.

Remark. Effectivity property plays a significant role in the algebraic formulation of the Taylor formula specified for a family FORMULA  of many right invertible operators, which is the algebraic counterpart of the well known Taylor formula for functions of many variables.
