The electronic structures of supercells of CeOFORMULA 
have been calculated within
the Density Functional Theory (DFT).
The equilibrium properties such as lattice constants, bulk moduli
and magnetic moments are well reproduced by the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA).
Electronic excitations are simulated by
robust total energy calculations for constrained states
with atomic core holes or valence holes. Pristine ceria
CeOFORMULA  is found to be a non-magnetic insulator with
magnetism setting in as soon as oxygens are removed from the structure.
In the ground state of defective ceria, the Ce-FORMULA 
majority band resides near the Fermi level,
but appears at about 2 eV below
the Fermi level in photoemission spectroscopy experiments
due to final state effects.
We also tested our computational method by calculating
threshold energies in Ce-MFORMULA  and O-K x-ray absorption
spectroscopy and comparing theoretical
predictions with the corresponding measurements.
Our result that FORMULA  electrons
reside near the Fermi level in the
ground state of oxygen
deficient ceria
is crucial for understanding the catalytic
properties of
CeOFORMULA  and related materials.

Introduction
Mixed-valency cerium oxides (ceria) are
technologically important materials
{{cite:32e4e3a8-8b07-459f-aab6-5625dc297965}}, {{cite:6cc6b4c6-f35c-4def-bdbc-23e970d22318}}, {{cite:737f70b5-d845-44f8-8773-482f0b5dde02}}
with remarkable properties that are useful
for applications
in heterogeneous chemical {{cite:53b4c97a-44c9-48bc-b2e7-4a9f260f1182}}
and electrochemical catalysis
{{cite:5ca0bf64-0c6e-4ea9-ba13-c3072f1bb729}}, {{cite:4e69b857-354e-4dab-857d-eca54b710271}}, {{cite:58ebf05b-3978-4ddc-9151-1ea5532d3a12}}, {{cite:d48badcd-73e2-4687-b027-f0368ded83a7}}.
In chemical catalysis, ceria is used as an active support.
Ceria at an interface catalyzes surface reactions {{cite:33da0d07-96c7-43d8-923a-40ff5c2a7872}}, {{cite:7d12ccc5-5b21-4d15-bada-91c13f73e0f4}},
while the bulk material is used as an oxygen reservoir.
In electro-catalysis, on the other hand,
mixed ionic and electronic conductivity
(with electrons localized around Ce) {{cite:640eaa16-232b-489a-892b-ba3613760c71}}, {{cite:b63ca6dd-b480-4413-b527-0e435166bc76}}
is essential for making ceria a potentially good
electrode in solid oxide fuel cells {{cite:8a8daa12-5733-42b7-b081-790b14882b3e}}, {{cite:d4b97bf2-0052-4ec9-b24a-ced744255d47}}, {{cite:0fff499a-d126-4e3c-97c3-df6b9b2c3c70}}, {{cite:214c6eb7-583e-48a1-9883-d1d9efde40a2}}
with an outstanding electrocatalytic
activity even without any metal
co-catalyst {{cite:64a6a3a4-6cb6-4d70-97da-5c38792ad9bd}}.
CeFORMULA  and oxygen vacancies are thought to be the active sites
on ceria surfaces {{cite:93d6d10e-2566-49eb-9caa-17375aa40893}}, {{cite:4c457da9-c025-4fd7-a9b5-bd688d0b03db}}, {{cite:65d6c663-b41c-45cf-9ba3-6d7922de4df2}}
in reactions such as hydrolysis, with the
surface undergoing a CeFORMULA / CeFORMULA  redox cycle during
the complete catalytic reaction.
In the pristine CeOFORMULA  compound, Ce atoms assume a +4 oxidation state, but
the phase diagram of ceria contains a continuous range of partially reduced
phases CeOFORMULA  in which oxygen vacancies can be easily formed or eliminated.
The formation of oxygen vacancies in CeOFORMULA 
results in changes in cerium oxidation state
similar to those implicated in the cuprates {{cite:b7a38c95-617f-467f-a9f7-c107acfb6326}}.
Notably, the Ce valence and defect structure in ceria
can change in response to physical parameters such as temperature,
voltage, and oxygen partial pressure {{cite:4e69b857-354e-4dab-857d-eca54b710271}}.
The nature of the Ce active site remains not well-understood
because studies with ceria are complicated by the fact
that the FORMULA  electrons appear to be far from the Fermi
level. The degree of participation of FORMULA -electrons in catalytic reactions
{{cite:07747942-f8a4-449b-b9bd-d253c7bedabe}}, {{cite:53682065-a064-4505-a64c-5029231456ab}}, {{cite:a5209cc0-8974-4e8a-ad4c-350add66c9dc}}, {{cite:de18b370-e478-4d85-be7d-1ac9a83cd7a0}} is therefore not clear, since
the standard theory of catalysis heavily relies on localized FORMULA  orbitals
at the Fermi energy, FORMULA  {{cite:87f8f089-79f5-4489-b4bf-30aef27bf0ed}}. Fortunately,
the computational description of perfect CeOFORMULA 
structure is not so complicated due to the
absence of Ce 4FORMULA  electrons in the insulating material
{{cite:cb388f3e-5508-418d-862c-18a7684bfca7}}, {{cite:ea5f5e84-3070-421e-b04a-604c502d6e54}}. However, in CeOFORMULA ,
when partially filled FORMULA  orbitals are involved,
the ground state predicted by the density-functional theory
(DFT) clearly places the FORMULA  electrons in narrow bands
piled at FORMULA , interacting only weakly with other electrons.
Since the elusive FORMULA -transition
in pure Ce can be described quite accurately
by temperature dependent DFT calculations
in which vibrational, electronic and magnetic free energies are
taken into account, {{cite:9f151ba8-b1a5-4213-b109-8692a8c94ea8}}, DFT should be expected to provide
a reasonable description of ceria. In fact, corrections to the value of
the chemical expansion coefficient FORMULA  {{cite:da54da34-8a47-406d-aba9-98f7b298c042}}
have been explained via disorder and entropy effects
enhancing lattice expansion {{cite:9f151ba8-b1a5-4213-b109-8692a8c94ea8}} rather than via correlations beyond the
Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) {{cite:2da573bf-30bb-4d81-95d9-7898c02faf07}}.
In sharp contrast, however, signatures of FORMULA  bands are often found in
spectroscopic measurements not at the Fermi energy FORMULA ,
as GGA predicts, but several eV's above
or below FORMULA  depending on the nature of the spectroscopy.
These shortcomings may be cured in an advanced DFT approach
{{cite:a4a129fd-7e16-4356-8e8f-ed6893b1ebc4}}, which includes relaxation energies relevant for excitation
of occupied and empty states in various spectroscopic probes.
These relaxation energies are of the order
of the corrections obtained within quasi-particle
schemes {{cite:09671614-03c0-47b7-aca8-43c77c08ecf3}}, {{cite:30457c04-2de4-4739-be34-c858270e76c4}} or modeled by adding a Hubbard FORMULA 
term {{cite:690d21b7-c539-4f74-b0e0-a2386cbc4fd4}}. Overall, the published studies that consider
CeOFORMULA  cover the range of FORMULA  parameter between 2 and 8 eV,
depending on the property of interest
{{cite:d4e2813e-0720-4f8e-a8e1-c30071810b66}}, {{cite:064ae845-30d1-4484-a1f0-d2753be20369}}, {{cite:79ec9b5d-a6e5-4d33-bc39-6fa707f9e757}}, {{cite:79440c47-fb9b-4cb4-be49-9648d5582481}}, {{cite:ba664c0e-9d96-4dec-b89e-b70cc6c26b33}}, {{cite:a9bb9e95-b518-4f6d-9549-61969e09f872}}, {{cite:431d3084-5ca8-4840-ad7d-ba3495144678}}.
Many-body perturbation theory with FORMULA  {{cite:f74d7c75-65b7-4636-8048-77daa0d1e3ca}},
self-interaction corrections {{cite:065a5d20-1291-4502-84de-1105e79eae03}},
and hybrid DFT functionals have also been considered
{{cite:b5f6e5c0-6767-4625-9bb8-67f84b5f4fb1}}, {{cite:caa1ef24-5593-4c8b-b796-b2e7c730c04e}}. In the present study, we explore the relaxation energy
approach {{cite:a4a129fd-7e16-4356-8e8f-ed6893b1ebc4}} to find a reasonable description
of x-ray photoemission (XPS) as well as x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results in CeOFORMULA .
An outline of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we present
details of our electronic structure and total energy computations
for various CeOFORMULA  supercells where FORMULA .
Results of the calculations are presented and compared
with relevant experimental data in Sec. III, and the conclusions
are given in Sec. IV.

Experimental setup and Method of calculation
The photoelectron spectroscopy experiments were performed at beamline 9.3.2 at
the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley). Detailed description of the AP-XPS
endstation used in this study and the ceria thin films sample preparation can be
found in Refs. Ref1,Ref2.
The Fermi level was determined by using a gold foil.
The binding energy was also calibrated by using the Pt 4FORMULA  core level.
The Ce 4FORMULA  spectrum was collected at a photon energy of 270 eV
{{cite:b3fb4245-83af-4ea9-8158-59711d5c29e6}}. In the interest of brevity, we refer to previous publications for
further details of measurements. {{cite:b3fb4245-83af-4ea9-8158-59711d5c29e6}}, {{cite:49029616-79be-4c34-bd34-214620d2f9a8}}
In order to determine various equilibrium properties, we used
the pseudo-potential projected augmented wave method {{cite:583559cc-fc8d-4b1e-8b30-817f83a4ba85}}
implemented in the VASP package {{cite:b4864bc0-73e8-459d-b9fb-6375a56ecc2a}}
with an energy cutoff of 520 eV for the plane-wave basis set.
CeOFORMULA  has a cubic fluorite lattice (FmFORMULA m)
with four cerium and eight oxygen atoms per unit cell.
The exchange-correlation energy was computed
using the GGA functional {{cite:7b5d29ee-9320-4a4d-a5af-d10c96115da2}},
which gives a reasonable agreement
with experimental low temperature
equilibrium volumes for CeOFORMULA  and CeFORMULA OFORMULA .
Andersson et al. {{cite:d4e2813e-0720-4f8e-a8e1-c30071810b66}}
have pointed out that this agreement is not maintained if
a non-zero Coulomb parameter FORMULA  is deployed in the GGA scheme.
To estimate the XPS and XAS relaxation effects, we have
performed self-consistent first-principles calculations
using the the Linear Muffin-Tin Orbital (LMTO) method {{cite:125cd168-c169-464f-b90e-3518dcc5c258}}
within the Local Spin Density Approximation
(LSDA) {{cite:24b20bed-442a-41ae-80b0-68535865a6e6}} as in Ref. {{cite:a4a129fd-7e16-4356-8e8f-ed6893b1ebc4}}
for supercells containing 4 or 8 formula units of CeOFORMULA .
The same LMTO method has been successfully applied previously
to study the effect of doping copper oxide high temperature
superconductors {{cite:b7a38c95-617f-467f-a9f7-c107acfb6326}}, {{cite:514e6823-55ce-41c0-9d63-a1ba15129f2f}}.
Here, empty spheres were inserted in the interstitial
region opposite to the oxygen atoms, a total of 16 or 32 spheres per supercell.
Defective ceria CeOFORMULA  configurations
were modeled with the supercell method by considering
two concentrations: FORMULA  and FORMULA , in the 16
and 32 atom supercells, respectively.{{cite:1bae58af-dfda-45c8-83bc-bb6aa611dcd6}}
The converged self-consistent results were obtained
using a mesh of 286 or 89 FORMULA -points
within the irreducible Brillouin zone for the small and large
supercells, respectively.
These calculations were made for a lattice constant FORMULA  of
5.45 Å  for stoichiometric CeOFORMULA 
and 5.54 Å  when vacancies are present.
The atomic sphere radii in the LMTO calculations are
0.303FORMULA  for Ce, 0.230FORMULA  for O and 0.196FORMULA 
for the empty spheres.
A precise tetrahedron method was used to determine the
density-of-states (DOS) {{cite:83eb5290-e797-445c-9791-1a0f5e13e97a}}.
In order to calculate the XAS threshold energy,
we start with the electronic structure
obtained within the LMTO method.
Our approach for modeling XAS {{cite:e2c339c6-0f54-47b5-845a-7cb86fffa227}} assumes
that the absorption is essentially a screened single-particle process.
A step to account for many-body relaxation effects is to extract an electron
from the core shell and add it into the valence states.
The electronic structure computations were carried out self-consistently
under these constrained conditions.
After the system has relaxed, we consider the
total energy difference between the unperturbed
state and the relaxed state to determine
the XAS threshold energy.
The calculation of the excitation energy
in x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS)
from the occupied Ce-FORMULA  state is made in the same way as
in our earlier study of NdFORMULA CuOFORMULA  {{cite:a4a129fd-7e16-4356-8e8f-ed6893b1ebc4}}.
Excitation energies for localized FORMULA -electrons are different from
those for itinerant electrons, since relaxation
effects are smaller for itinerant bands.
An electron is removed at an energy lying just
below the Fermi level from the occupied
majority state on one of the Ce atoms, and it is then spread out uniformly
over the cell to account for a final
state at high energy. The difference in total
energy per electron between this state and the
ground state gives the relaxation energy,
FORMULA  defined in Appendix A. In particular, the final state will
appear shifted by an amount FORMULA  with
respect the Fermi level. The procedure for simulating inverse photoemission
(or bremsstrahlung isocromat spectroscopy, BIS) is
reversed. The final state then has one FORMULA -electron in
an empty Ce-FORMULA  state and the same
amount of opposite neutralizing charge is spread
uniformly over the cell. These procedures assume
large excitation energies because the compensating
uniform charges are valid approximations
for free electron states ignoring the lattice potential
{{cite:90aece90-477e-43fd-ab86-b26e8c28a4bf}}.

results of the VASP based calculations on a CeFORMULA OFORMULA  cell
as function of the number FORMULA  of oxygen vacancies.
Both volume and atomic positions were relaxed while
keeping the cubic symmetry. For each FORMULA  the configuration with the lowest energy was chosen.

The VASP calculation on a CeFORMULA OFORMULA  cell gives an equilibrium lattice constant
FORMULA  Å  and a bulk modulus FORMULA  GPa, which compare well with the corresponding
low-temperature experimental values FORMULA  Å  {{cite:e17003ce-22eb-49fc-85d1-a7c866e528be}}
FORMULA  GPa {{cite:0a95c5f1-054c-497d-963c-fd967b297195}}. By removing an oxygen atom and by letting
the volume and the atomic positions relax,
the lattice constant was found to expand to FORMULA  Å ,
the bulk modulus reduced to FORMULA  GPa,
and the total spin magnetic moment was 2 FORMULA .
This predicted ferromagnetic structure is consistent
with experiments {{cite:5411ce17-9812-44c1-96be-20e191a9d478}}, {{cite:5b5335ca-35b5-44df-b635-ab6d48bcb7f2}}, {{cite:ec32d5f4-c7d2-4092-9962-d3a5eb882c29}}
and other first principles studies {{cite:6eaf7766-322c-44a2-ac04-08484b588fb9}}.
We note that by removing all the oxygen atoms, one recovers
the fcc-phase of Ce, and the
calculated bulk modulus is only 51.4 GPa for
the non-magnetic FORMULA  phase
at an equilibrium lattice constant of 4.714Å.
Our results for CeFORMULA OFORMULA 
as a function of the number FORMULA  of oxygen vacancies
are summarized in Fig. REF .
The calculated chemical expansion coefficient
of CeOFORMULA  is given by
FORMULA .
However, our results for O-vacancies in the
small unit cell CeFORMULA OFORMULA 
show that FORMULA  is not at all linear. In fact,
between FORMULA  and FORMULA , FORMULA  is FORMULA , while
between FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
FORMULA , which is slightly below the experimental value
FORMULA  {{cite:da54da34-8a47-406d-aba9-98f7b298c042}}.
Part of the anomalous behavior of FORMULA 
can be explained in term of oxygen vacancy ordering leading to
lattice contractions opposite to the chemical expansion{{cite:f73e9abb-b8b3-46bc-a831-dead6066b3c0}}.
The GGA calculation for one vacancy in a large FORMULA 
supercell with 95 atoms gives a larger dilute vacancy limit (FORMULA ) FORMULA  as shown by Marrocchelli et al..
Therefore, calculated values of FORMULA  are not easy to compare with experiment within large ranges of FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The discrepancy between DFT and the experiment
could be explained by disorder and entropy effects leading to larger
high-temperature equilibrium volumes {{cite:9f151ba8-b1a5-4213-b109-8692a8c94ea8}}.
The electronic entropy will increase the
lattice constant of oxygen-deficient ceria, since the
DOS near the Fermi level is higher at large volume and large FORMULA ,
although this effect is rather weak.
Lattice disorder is caused both by zero-point
motion {{cite:2da573bf-30bb-4d81-95d9-7898c02faf07}} and thermal vibrations {{cite:efe71cf5-453c-4f6b-9df1-8cf959062e6a}},
which produce a pressure given by FORMULA ,
where the phonon frequency FORMULA  is proportional to
FORMULA . Also the effect of spin and orbital magnetic fluctuations
usually produce lattice expansions as shown in Ref. {{cite:9f151ba8-b1a5-4213-b109-8692a8c94ea8}}.
The relevant temperature range for catalytic applications is rather high
(i.e. FORMULA  FORMULA C) {{cite:b3fb4245-83af-4ea9-8158-59711d5c29e6}} and the effects
from lattice vibrations on magnetic fluctuations
in this range make the total entropy balance complicated.

 FIGURE
Total DOS for CeFORMULA OFORMULA  calculated from 286 FORMULA -points.
The Fermi level is at zero.

The LMTO electronic structure of CeOFORMULA 
is found to be non-magnetic and
insulating as shown in Fig. REF .
The distance between the valence band
and the Ce 4FORMULA  edge is about 1.6 eV,
to be compared with 3 eV
in experiments {{cite:cb388f3e-5508-418d-862c-18a7684bfca7}}, {{cite:daefb1bd-e18e-4509-9007-4e81b316b1fe}}.
Ferromagnetism (FM) is not expected because
of the absence of occupied Ce 4FORMULA  electrons.
An oxygen atom has 4 valence FORMULA  electrons.
But all 3 O-2FORMULA  bands are below FORMULA  and
can harbor 6 electrons (2 spins in each band).
Therefore, each removal of an O-atom
removes 3 occupied FORMULA -bands, but since the system has
only 4 fewer electrons, this
means that FORMULA  will rise, and one more band will
be occupied to account for the two additional electrons. Thus,
an oxygen vacancy introduces partially filled Ce FORMULA  states and the FM ordering sets in because the high DOS of Ce-FORMULA  states produces a Stoner exchange splitting. The calculated moment is 0.52 FORMULA  per Ce atom in CeOFORMULA  and the FM state has a lower total energy (FORMULA ) than the non-magnetic state by 0.14 eV per formula unit. The induced moment per oxygen is negative, about 0.01 FORMULA , and the total moment per CeFORMULA OFORMULA  cell is exactly 2.0 FORMULA , or 0.50 FORMULA  per CeOFORMULA  unit. The FM state is half-metallic with no minority bands at FORMULA , and as expected from the qualitative discussion above,
the charge transfer to the majority states is exactly 2 spin states per cell,
see Figs. REF  and REF .
Consequently, there also are exactly 2 more majority states than minority states
in the calculation for the 32-site cell CeFORMULA OFORMULA ,
which corresponds to CeOFORMULA . Here there are two types of Ce sites, the 4 closest to the O-vacancy, CeFORMULA , has each a moment of 0.33 FORMULA  and the 4 towards the interior, CeFORMULA , have 0.19 FORMULA  each {{cite:be1e7cd3-26a3-4e9b-bcab-74427450163d}}. Together with the small negative moments on the oxygen this gives
exactly 2.0 FORMULA  per CeFORMULA OFORMULA  cell, or
0.25 FORMULA  per CeOFORMULA  unit. In other words, the removal of one
oxygen atom gives rise to a spin magnetic moment of FORMULA 
in the dilute vacancy limit (FORMULA ).

Excited-state properties
Table REF  compares measured positions of
several Kohn-Sham core energy levels with the corresponding
calculated XAS threshold energies.
Clearly, the total energy calculations give XAS threshold
energies in much better agreement
with experiments {{cite:633eca33-a49b-4ecf-8d9e-3cdc04972bd0}}, {{cite:bca93297-3d1d-4739-9133-699813649766}}, {{cite:ec32d5f4-c7d2-4092-9962-d3a5eb882c29}}
compared to just taking the Kohn-Sham energy of the core level relative
to FORMULA . Note that we are not looking for absolute values,
but rather for relative differences between
FM and non-magnetic configurations with or without vacancies.
In particular, the value of the Ce M-edge threshold is reduced by about
1 eV for an oxygen vacancy in the small supercell CeFORMULA OFORMULA 
and this value is consistent with the displacements
of the CeFORMULA OFORMULA  {{cite:bca93297-3d1d-4739-9133-699813649766}} and
of the metallic Ce {{cite:633eca33-a49b-4ecf-8d9e-3cdc04972bd0}} threshold energies toward lower values.
In the large super-cell, CeFORMULA OFORMULA , the Ce-3FORMULA  Kohn-Sham core levels
differ by 0.44 eV between the two types of Ce sites.
The threshold of oxygen K-edge position seems less affected
by the formation of O vacancies in ceria in agreement with
measurements performed in oxygen-deficient CeOFORMULA  nanoparticles {{cite:ec32d5f4-c7d2-4092-9962-d3a5eb882c29}}.

 TABLE

The results for the XPS and BIS excitation energy per electron
given in Table REF  show trends similar to those given
in Ref. {{cite:a4a129fd-7e16-4356-8e8f-ed6893b1ebc4}} for NdFORMULA CeFORMULA CuOFORMULA .
In particular, the relaxation corrections for defective ceria
split the single FORMULA  peak in LSDA to an occupied
and an unoccupied FORMULA  band.
The former falls below and the latter lies above FORMULA .
Our XPS calculations predict that the FORMULA  occupied peak appears at
about 1 eV below the Fermi level while
experimentally the position of this peak seems to be even lower.
Typical in situ or in operando Ce 4FORMULA  and Ce 3FORMULA  x-ray photoelectron
spectra of a ceria electrode are shown in Fig. 3a of Ref. {{cite:b3fb4245-83af-4ea9-8158-59711d5c29e6}}.
Figure 7 of Ref. {{cite:49029616-79be-4c34-bd34-214620d2f9a8}} provides the
spatially resolved spectral image of the Ce 4FORMULA  valence band, allowing visualization of
regions of electrochemical activity in a
ceria electrode. In fact, the presence of CeFORMULA  species is revealed
by the intensity of the Ce 4FORMULA  occupied peak at about 2 eV binding energy
as already demonstrated by ex situ results {{cite:da22685b-d9f8-4999-9ab7-f009324d2ef8}}.
The Ce 3FORMULA  XPS core-level spectra display
different final-state populations of 4FORMULA ,
which lead to the peak splitting shown
in Fig. 3b of Ref. {{cite:b3fb4245-83af-4ea9-8158-59711d5c29e6}}.
The final state effects lead to
an upward shift of the lowest binding Ce-3FORMULA 
peak attributed to the CeFORMULA  state
[see also Ce 3FORMULA  XPS spectra in Fig.1 of Ref. {{cite:da22685b-d9f8-4999-9ab7-f009324d2ef8}}],
which is consistent with the shift of the calculated
Ce 3FORMULA  XAS threshold {{cite:13962f6f-87b6-477c-87e4-d2c793aa7535}} given in Table REF .
For the smaller unit cell, CeFORMULA OFORMULA , where all the Ce atoms are equivalent,
we find that the occupied FORMULA  band shifts only by FORMULA  eV,
indicating that the degree of localization of the FORMULA  orbital
plays an important role in the value of the energy shift.
If we take the atomic positions relaxed by VASP,
the energy shift becomes FORMULA  eV.
Therefore, the correction due to atomic relaxation is of the order of FORMULA  eV.
Calculations were also made for the large cell, CeFORMULA OFORMULA , where
both CeFORMULA  and CeFORMULA  give the same position for the FORMULA  occupied peak
at about 1 eV below FORMULA  {{cite:26f0ddcc-d76a-4a56-8678-cf904c83eff0}}.
This is consistent with the observation that
the Ce 4FORMULA  binding energy does not change much with
the vacancy concentration, but that different contributions from different sites
lead to some broadening. Therefore, the excess electrons left behind by the removal of neutral oxygen atoms produce occupied FORMULA  states with practically the same 2 eV binding energy. The reason for the underestimation of the theoretical XPS relaxation is not known, but several mechanisms may be involved.
As shown above, part of the correction is due to lattice relaxation near the vacancies. Other possible modifications of the Ce potential would result at surface sites or due to atomic vibrations. Interestingly, the calculated shift for the FORMULA  states in NdFORMULA CeFORMULA CuOFORMULA  {{cite:a4a129fd-7e16-4356-8e8f-ed6893b1ebc4}} has also been found to be about 2 eV. It is also possible that the approximation of a completely
delocalized excited state is less appropriate for Ce at these energies.

Conclusions
We have obtained electronic structures of supercells of CeOFORMULA  within
the framework of the DFT. The experimental equilibrium lattice constants,
bulk moduli and magnetic moments are well reproduced by the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) without
the need to introduce a large Coulomb parameter FORMULA .
The computed value of lattice chemical expansion FORMULA  as a function of O-vacancy concentration
is not linear for FORMULA  ranging from 0 to 1.
Pristine CeOFORMULA  is found to be a non-magnetic insulator with
magnetism setting in as soon as oxygens are removed from the structure.
Excitation properties are simulated via constrained total energy calculations,
and Ce-M and O-K edge x-ray absorption threshold energies are discussed.
Our study shows that the way the ground state is probed by different
spectroscopies can be modified significantly through final state effects. {{cite:a4a129fd-7e16-4356-8e8f-ed6893b1ebc4}}
In particular, these relaxation effects yield
a renormalization of FORMULA -levels away from the
Fermi Level for electron excitation spectroscopies.
Our result that FORMULA  electrons reside near the Fermi level in the ground state of oxygen
deficient ceria is crucial for understanding catalytic
properties of CeOFORMULA  and related materials.{{cite:87f8f089-79f5-4489-b4bf-30aef27bf0ed}}.

Details of Constrained DFT Computations
In the XPS final state, one whole electron is
transferred from the ground-state to a homogeneous
plane-wave single-particle state. We can simulate this process by creating
a hole obtained by removing states from the local DOS (LDOS)
over a narrow energy window FORMULA , where FORMULA  is the Fermi energy
in the excited state and FORMULA 
is a cut-off energy.
The electronic density FORMULA  associated with the hole at the site FORMULA  is
FORMULA 
Here, FORMULA  is the self-consistent LDOS and FORMULA 
is the radial wave function component at the site FORMULA  with angular momentum FORMULA .
The total electron density FORMULA  for the excited state thus is
FORMULA 
where the last term in Eq. REF  imposes charge neutrality within
the simulation cell of volume FORMULA .
The charge density in the final state FORMULA  allows us to
determine the total energy FORMULA  of the excited state.
The electrostatic and exchange-correlation contributions
are evaluated straightforwardly from FORMULA .
The kinetic energy corresponding to the
excited charge density does not involve a single energy level of the solid
but rather a group of states and it can be calculated
using the standard expression given by Janak {{cite:c76f0b7b-0580-4f68-82e2-8352dc809812}}, which involves
the Kohn-Sham energy average
FORMULA 
In this way, the total energy FORMULA  can be obtained in terms of the Kohn-Sham
energy average FORMULA  and the hole density FORMULA 
exactly as in the XAS threshold energy calculations within the FORMULA 
self-consistent-field (FORMULA SCF) method {{cite:e2c339c6-0f54-47b5-845a-7cb86fffa227}}, {{cite:28fadcea-6806-4738-9b84-960396ea17c9}}.
Finally, the energy FORMULA  of the XPS photoelectron
is given by {{cite:f7b14c33-cda8-4565-9ab6-3d5a29989a3a}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the photon energy, FORMULA  is the ground state energy,
and FORMULA  is the Fermi level for the excited state. If KoopmansÕ theorem applies
FORMULA 
where the Kohn-Sham energy average
FORMULA 
is calculated in the ground state. The difference between
Eq. REF  and Eq. REF 
defines the relaxation energy FORMULA .
DFT is expected to give a reasonable description
of the energy difference FORMULA 
involved in the photoemission process{{cite:fa2896a0-95e3-4bce-b2d3-e297486419d8}}.
In order to focus on the excitation corresponding
to a given DOS peak, in actual computations, we considered a narrow
energy interval FORMULA  containing
a fraction FORMULA  of an electron per site FORMULA ,
and renormalized the result to obtain FORMULA 
to account for a whole electron
involved in the XPS process {{cite:26f0ddcc-d76a-4a56-8678-cf904c83eff0}}.
We have performed test computations using a range of FORMULA  values
and found that the relaxation energy is very insensitive to the value of FORMULA  used,
which is also anticipated from the analysis of Ref. {{cite:26d9f802-faa4-40bf-ad26-19aae905ac0b}}.
Note that placing the hole on only one of the sites in the unit
cell is an approximation for removing a band electron in that it
neglects
the overlap of the wave function with neighboring sites.
This however is expected to be a reasonable approximation for localized
FORMULA -electrons of interest here. To check this point,
we computed the excitation energy self-consistently in CeFORMULA OFORMULA 
where we removed 1/4th of an FORMULA -electron from each of the 4 Ce atoms
in the unit cell, i.e. a total of one electron from the unit cell.
The value of the relaxation energy so obtained was 0.75 eV compared to 0.7 eV
shown in Table II, which
is within the intrinsic error of 0.05 eV in our total energy computations.
