Introduction
The geometry of spaces of rational curves of low degree on Fano threefolds is a very active
area of algebraic geometry. One of the main goals is to understand the Abel-Jacobi morphism
from the base of a family
of such curves to the intermediate Jacobian of the threefold. For instance, does a given family of curves
dominate the intermediate Jacobian? If so, what are the fibers of this morphism? Does it
give the maximal rationally connected (MRC) quotient?
Representative results in this direction are available for:

cubic threefolds {{cite:7ba7ffad-4e14-4300-921b-ced2ff4db188}}, {{cite:39a7241d-940d-4a4b-bf69-2c7bb1b8a60f}}, {{cite:e252f13c-2b5b-486d-83a6-e6c16ec4f632}}, {{cite:5dfb280f-8c3a-4cce-8002-2d21a23ab0f5}};

Fano threefolds of genus six and degree 10 in FORMULA  {{cite:d9974aae-bbf8-48a4-aed0-9159d60108ff}};

Fano threefolds of genus seven and degree 12 in FORMULA  {{cite:373e9ae1-6407-4d2b-8d0e-ce7e07c38838}};

moduli of vector bundles {{cite:5dcd1a50-b72a-4bc2-8bf3-92112c59bf0b}}—this case makes clear that
one cannot always expect the morphism to the intermediate
Jacobian to give the MRC fibration.

At the same time, del Pezzo fibrations
FORMULA  are equally interesting
geometrically. Moreover, the special case where the rational curves
happen to be sections of FORMULA  is particularly important
for arithmetic applications. It is a major open problem to determine
whether or not sections exist
over a non-closed ground field. Of course, the Tsen-Lang theorem
gives sections when the ground field is algebraically closed.
Even when there are rigid sections,
these are typically defined over extensions of large degree.
However, suppose that the space of sections
of fixed height is rationally connected over
the intermediate Jacobian FORMULA . If the fibration
is defined over a finite field and the space of sections descends
to this field then FORMULA  has sections over that field.
Indeed, this follows by combining a theorem of Lang {{cite:a2bd40e2-f8b5-42f2-98be-5df08d0f5481}}
(principal homogeneous spaces
for abelian varities over finite fields are trivial) and
a theorem of Esnault {{cite:5c2f389d-63e2-46dc-80c0-b868522431d6}} (rationally connected varieties
over finite fields have rational points). This point of view
was developed for quadric surface bundles in {{cite:08ae1f8d-9b89-4486-9fbe-2f43c12791c0}},
with applications to effective versions of weak approximation.
This paper addresses the case of quartic del Pezzo fibrations
FORMULA . Throughout, we assume FORMULA  is smooth
and the degenerate fibers of FORMULA  have at worst one ordinary singularity.
We classify numerical invariants of the family—the fundamental
invariant is the height, denoted FORMULA . We provide
explicit geometric realizations for fibrations of small height.
We exhibit families of
sections parametrizing the intermediate Jacobian and admitting
rationally-connected fibrations over the intermediate Jacobian.
The underlying constructions often involve Brill-Noether theory
for smooth or nodal curves.
Our main result is the comprehensive analysis of spaces of small-height sections
for height 12 fibrations in Section ; here FORMULA  dominates a
nodal Fano threefold of genus seven and degree 12.

Basic properties of quartic del Pezzo surfaces
Let FORMULA  be a quartic del Pezzo surface over an algebraically closed field.
FORMULA  is isomorphic to FORMULA  blown up at five distinct points
such that no three are collinear. Thus we may identify
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the pull-back of the hyperplane class on FORMULA  and the FORMULA 
are the exceptional divisors.
The primitive divisors
FORMULA 
are a lattice under the intersection form; using the basis
FORMULA 
we have
FORMULA 
Writing FORMULA , the intersection form gives a
surjection
FORMULA 
with kernel generated by FORMULA .
Note that FORMULA  is a cyclic group of order four.
The action of the monodromy group on FORMULA  factors through the Weyl group
FORMULA  coming from the FORMULA  root system contained in the lattice FORMULA .
Abstractly, FORMULA  may be realized as an extension of the symmetric group
FORMULA 
concretely, this is the subgroup of the group of signed
FORMULA  permutation matrices
where the determinant of the matrix equals the sign of the permutation.
The anticanonical model of FORMULA  is a complete
intersection of two quadrics
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  denote the Grassmannian
parametrizing pencils of quadrics in FORMULA . The group FORMULA  acts naturally on
FORMULA  and this Grassmannian, linearized
via the Plücker embedding.
Consider the loci of stable and semistable points
FORMULA 
and the resulting GIT quotient
FORMULA 
Principal results of {{cite:d40a0737-722d-4143-8260-407f6042f740}} include:

FORMULA  coincides with the locus of smooth quartic del Pezzo surfaces;

FORMULA  parametrizes quartic del Pezzo surfaces with at worst ordinary double points;

smooth quartic del Pezzo surfaces are diagonalizable, i.e., there
exist coordinates FORMULA  on FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 

closed orbits in FORMULA  correspond to diagonalizable del Pezzo surfaces,
which have FORMULA , or 4 ordinary double points;

the determinantal scheme of a quartic del Pezzo surface
FORMULA 
induces a rational map
FORMULA 
regular on FORMULA .
Consequently, we obtain an isomorphism of projective schemes
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the moduli space of stable rational curves with five marked
points, with the canonical action of the symmetric group on five letters.

The diagonal representation of a smooth quartic del Pezzo surface
has useful implications:
Consider the group FORMULA , realized as FORMULA  diagonal
matrices with FORMULA  on the diagonal modulo the subgroup FORMULA .
Then FORMULA  acts on FORMULA  and this action is transitive on
the 16 lines of FORMULA .
The closure in FORMULA  of the
orbit of any quartic del Pezzo surface with
a unique ordinary double point contains quartic del Pezzo surfaces with
at least two ordinary double points. Indeed, quartic del Pezzo surfaces
with one ordinary double point are strictly semistable but have orbits
that are not closed.
In particular, the moduli stack of quartic del Pezzo surfaces with
ordinary singularities is non-separated.
Concretely, fix a quartic del Pezzo surface FORMULA  with one ordinary singularity.
Supposing
the singularity is at FORMULA 
with tangent space FORMULA ,
and also that FORMULA  cuts out this tangent space and FORMULA  is nodal at FORMULA ,
we obtain
FORMULA 
Writing FORMULA 
and substituting FORMULA , we obtain
FORMULA 
Writing FORMULA  yields
FORMULA 
Consider the action of the one-parameter subgroup FORMULA  given by
FORMULA 
The limit
FORMULA 
has double points FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Moreover, when FORMULA  consists of four
distinct points we have
FORMULA 
i.e., the identity component of the automorphism group
corresponds to FORMULA .
It is a fundamental result of Geometric Invariant Theory
that the failure of separatedness is governed by
specializations under one-parameter subgroups arising as automorphisms
of objects with closed orbit
(see {{cite:d98cb228-b638-4909-ac3a-1cbf3266da96}}).
Note that there is a unique non-closed orbit in the basin of attraction
of FORMULA  under FORMULA .
Thus removing the semistable objects of type FORMULA 
eliminates the non-separatedness. Alternately, we could apply the Kirwan
blow-up process {{cite:40d294ec-9223-4a19-bff1-7563f6f7fd1f}} to eliminate semistable
points with positive-dimensional
stabilizers.
We summarize this discussion as follows:
Proposition 1 
Let FORMULA  denote the moduli stack of quartic del Pezzo surfaces with at worst
one ordinary double point, with coarse moduli space FORMULA . Then we have

FORMULA  (defined in (REF )) induces a morphism of stacks
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the zero-dimensional boundary stratum (see Figure REF );

FORMULA  induces an isomorphism of coarse moduli spaces
FORMULA 


FIGURE 
The invariants of binary quintics were computed in the 19th century; see
{{cite:db37e9dc-50a8-4722-81c6-e3b2c4873a9e}} for a description convenient for our purposes.
It follows that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the image of FORMULA , and a point where the minimal degree invariant is non-zero.
Thus we obtain
Corollary 2 
FORMULA .


Quartic del Pezzo fiber spaces over  FORMULA
We work over an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from two.
Proposition 3 
Let FORMULA  be a smooth projective threefold and FORMULA 
a morphism such that the generic fiber is a
smooth rational surface. Then

FORMULA  is separably rationally connected;

the Hodge numbers FORMULA  for FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA .


FORMULA  admits a section FORMULA . This follows from general results {{cite:33420afc-dead-4ec8-af60-9df43117f6ba}} or
by the classification of rational surfaces and the Tsen-Lang theorem (cf. {{cite:1b3157cf-86e7-42ed-a0ae-bc0c9f06fec7}}).
Since the smooth fibers of FORMULA  are rational surfaces, there exist very
free curves in the fibers incident to FORMULA . The techniques of {{cite:814e4185-919d-4ee1-8be2-41127f64acdc}}
thus yield a very free section of FORMULA , proving separably rational connectedness.
It follows {{cite:b9bae2c1-958a-4a6c-9861-4f20315a6e06}} that
FORMULA 
and by Serre duality
FORMULA 
The Leray spectral sequence for FORMULA  and Serre duality also give
FORMULA 
Assume that FORMULA  is a fibration of quartic del Pezzo surfaces,
with FORMULA  smooth.
The fibration has square-free discriminant if
the fibers are complete intersections of two quadrics
with at worst one ordinary double point; we assume this from now on.
Under these assumptions, the relative dualizing sheaf FORMULA 
is invertible, the direct image of its dual
FORMULA 
is locally free, and the higher direct images vanish. Cohomology-and-base-change
and the fact that FORMULA  is very ample on fibers of FORMULA  yield
an embedding FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  denote the ideal sheaf of FORMULA 
twisted by FORMULA ;
then FORMULA 
is a subbundle of rank two with quotient FORMULA .
Proposition 4 
Let FORMULA  be a fibration of quartic
del Pezzo surfaces with square-free discriminant,
defined over a field of characteristic FORMULA . Then
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are liftable to characteristic
zero.

Remark 5 
Assuming Proposition REF , the Hodge-de Rham
spectral sequence for FORMULA  degenerates provided FORMULA  (or FORMULA )
{{cite:a9efc1db-f925-45da-8a1e-804dc47abda4}}. Thus
FORMULA  equals the
Picard rank of FORMULA , and FORMULA  and FORMULA  are unchanged
on reduction to FORMULA  from characteristic zero.

Every vector bundle over FORMULA  decomposes as a direct
sum of line bundles
FORMULA 
Clearly any such direct sum lifts to characteristic
zero, i.e., lift each summand individually.
Cohomology commutes with reduction modulo FORMULA 
for such a lift; given lifts of two such bundles,
taking homomorphisms between them commutes with reduction as well.
In particular, we may lift the decomposition
of FORMULA  to characteristic zero;
the same holds true for FORMULA 
and its quotient
FORMULA . There is a combinatorial
criterion {{cite:ea2f3782-1c09-44e6-a1af-34af587bb9a4}}
for which vector bundles arise as subbundles
of a given bundle, independent of the characteristic.
In particular, the quotient homomorphism
FORMULA 
lifts to characteristic zero, as does its kernel.
The resulting rank-two subbundle gives the defining
equations of the lift of FORMULA  to characteristic zero.
Having square-free discriminant is an open condition,
so the resulting lift shares this property.
We define
FORMULA 
to be the height of the del Pezzo surface fibration.
Corollary REF  implies this is the unique numerical
invariant for families with square-free discriminant:
Proposition 6 
Let FORMULA  be a quartic del Pezzo fibration with square-free
discriminant.
Then we have:

FORMULA ;


FORMULA ;

the topological Euler characteristic
FORMULA 


FORMULA ;


FORMULA .


The quantities FORMULA  and FORMULA 
all depend on the degree of the classifying map FORMULA ,
thus are in constant proportion. To evaluate the proportionality
constant, it suffices to consider a singular non-constant example,
e.g., the intersection of a quadric in FORMULA  with a pencil of quadric
hypersurfaces. (See Case 1 of Section  for details.)
Once we know the number of singular fibers, it is straightforward
to compute the (étale) topological Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristics
of FORMULA  and FORMULA  are
related to the topological Euler characteristic via the Hodge-de Rham
spectral sequence
FORMULA 
Serre duality and Proposition REF  give
FORMULA 
Finally, the expected number
of parameters FORMULA , which may be computed by Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch
and Gauss-Bonnet:
FORMULA 
We have
FORMULA 
whence
FORMULA 
as claimed.
Combining with Proposition REF  and
Remark REF , we obtain
Corollary 7 Retain the notation and assumptions of Proposition REF ;
assume the characteristic FORMULA  (or FORMULA )
and set
FORMULA 
Then the Hodge diamond of FORMULA  takes the form
FORMULA 

This can be interpreted in geometric terms:
Let FORMULA  be a fibration of quartic del Pezzo surfaces
with square-free discriminant. Let FORMULA  be the degree-five
covering parametrizing nodal quadric hypersurfaces containing
the fibers of FORMULA , and FORMULA  the double covering parametrizing
rulings of these quadric hypersurfaces. The assumption on singular
fibers implies that FORMULA  is simply branched and FORMULA 
is étale, and we may consider the resulting Prym variety
FORMULA .
Proposition 8 Retaining the notation above, let FORMULA  denote codimension two cycles
algebraically equivalent to zero. Then FORMULA .

Fix a section FORMULA  of FORMULA , not passing through
any lines of the singular fibers. Projecting from
FORMULA  realizes the generic fiber of FORMULA  as a conic bundle over FORMULA .
Indeed, blowing up a quartic del Pezzo surface
at a point not on a line yields a cubic surface with a line; projecting
the cubic surface from that line gives a conic bundle over FORMULA .
There are five degenerate fibers, corresponding to the generic fiber
of FORMULA , and ten irreducible components in these fibers,
corresponding to the the generic fiber of FORMULA . Thus
the blow-up of FORMULA  along FORMULA  is a conic bundle over a Hirzebruch surface
surface, with discriminant curve FORMULA  and étale cover FORMULA .
A straightforward variation on the
argument of {{cite:f6b3daa5-2399-4fc5-adb5-7e7932f280ea}} implies that
FORMULA  the same holds for
FORMULA . (For related results, see {{cite:699dab68-30f8-43de-b7e2-d502fd271c1b}}.)
Remark 9 Over FORMULA , this Prym variety is the intermediate Jacobian FORMULA ;
its construction is compatible with reduction modulo FORMULA , assuming the
reduction still has square-free discriminant.
Even over fields of characteristic FORMULA , FORMULA 
has the requisite universal
property for one-cycles {{cite:f6b3daa5-2399-4fc5-adb5-7e7932f280ea}}: Given a family of
curves
FORMULA 
over a smooth connected base FORMULA , there is an Abel-Jacobi
morphism FORMULA .

The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem gives:
Proposition 10 
Let FORMULA  be a fibration of quartic del Pezzo surfaces.
Suppose FORMULA  is a smooth complete intersection of
ample divisors in FORMULA . Then
FORMULA .

Definition 11 Let FORMULA  be a quartic del Pezzo fibration with
square-free discriminant. The anticanonical height of a section FORMULA 
is defined
FORMULA 

Note that this equals the degree of the normal bundle FORMULA , thus the Hilbert
scheme of sections has dimension FORMULA  at FORMULA .

Explicit realization of generic families
In this section, we give concrete geometric realizations of families of each height.
We start by writing
FORMULA 
We refer the reader to {{cite:c723d466-de3d-405d-a2e5-2b0ef856881b}} for a discussion of which FORMULA  may occur.
Here we assume this sheaf is generic, in the sense that it is as
`balanced' as possible, i.e., FORMULA . Thus
FORMULA  is one of the following:

 FORMULA

 FORMULA

 FORMULA

 FORMULA

 FORMULA

where FORMULA . In this situation, Proposition REF 
may be proven by direct computations with resolutions.
Case 1
We compute invariants for generic quartic del Pezzo surfaces
FORMULA 
arising from morphisms into the Hilbert scheme
FORMULA 
of degree FORMULA , where FORMULA  is
an embedding transverse to the discriminant.
In this situation, we may embed
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
is a rank-two vector subbundle of degree FORMULA .
Even part
Assuming this bundle is generic and FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is a complete intersection of two forms of bidegree FORMULA .
As such, FORMULA  depends on
FORMULA 
parameters.
In this situation
FORMULA 
whence
FORMULA 
We compute the middle cohomology using the exact sequence
FORMULA 
where the conormal bundle
FORMULA 
Thus we find
FORMULA 
Using the Koszul resolution
FORMULA 
we compute
FORMULA 
The formulas
FORMULA 
FORMULA 
thus give
FORMULA 
When FORMULA  we obtain
FORMULA 
as well.
Remark 12 
The special case FORMULA  is a constant family of quartic del Pezzo surfaces,
which clearly has sections.


Odd part
Now assume FORMULA  so (REF ) takes the form
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is a complete intersection of forms of bidegrees FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In this situation
FORMULA 
whence
FORMULA 
Remark 13 
The base case FORMULA  is studied in Section , where we show that
it always admits a section FORMULA , defined over the coefficient field.


Case 2
We next consider
FORMULA 
contained in a complete intersection of a form FORMULA  of bidegree FORMULA .
Even part
Consider when FORMULA 
is a complete intersection of a form FORMULA  of bidegree FORMULA 
and two forms of bidegree FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be defined by the exact sequence
FORMULA 
For generic FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
We have
FORMULA 
and the projection formula yields
FORMULA 
whence
FORMULA 
Remark 14 
We analyze rational points in the case FORMULA . Consider the projection
FORMULA  onto the second factor; it is a complete intersection
of two quadrics. The fibration corresponds to a pencil of hyperplane sections of FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be its base locus, so that FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is
smooth, FORMULA  must be a smooth curve of genus one.
The constant subfamily
FORMULA 
has a section over the coefficient field FORMULA , provided FORMULA .


Odd part
Now consider
FORMULA 
as a complete intersection of a form FORMULA  of bidegree FORMULA ,
a form of bidegree FORMULA , and a form of bidegree FORMULA .
We have
FORMULA 
so that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is as above.
Thus we conclude
FORMULA 

Case 3
Consider
FORMULA 
as a complete intersection of two forms FORMULA  and FORMULA  of bidegree FORMULA 
and two additional
forms quadratic in the second factor.
Let FORMULA  be defined by the exact sequence
FORMULA 
for generic FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
As before, we have
FORMULA 
Even part
Suppose that the additional quadratic forms both have degree FORMULA .
Then FORMULA 
whence
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 

Odd part
Suppose that the additional forms have degrees FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Then FORMULA 
whence
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Example 15 (FORMULA  case)  
We do the FORMULA  case via a slightly different construction: Consider
the intersection of the forms FORMULA  and FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Note that
FORMULA 
which is nonzero if and only if FORMULA , e.g., if FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In this case, we have
FORMULA 
i.e., the space of sections has dimension 12. Furthermore, these all vanish along
the distinguished two-dimensional projective subbundle of FORMULA .
Since non-singular quadric threefolds contain no two-planes,
divisors FORMULA  in FORMULA  are fibered over FORMULA 
in singular quadric hypersurfaces.
Let FORMULA  where FORMULA  has bidegree FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA  is the pullback of a quadric from FORMULA .
The image of FORMULA  in FORMULA  is
a quadric hypersurface.
Since FORMULA  is contained in a singular quadric hypersurface, its monodromy is non-maximal; indeed, FORMULA 
acts on the five singular quadric hypersurfaces containing FORMULA 
via the canonical homomorphism FORMULA . This is consistent
with Proposition REF .

Remark 16 
Let FORMULA  denote the intersection of the distinguished two-plane in FORMULA  with FORMULA ; we have a constant subfamily
FORMULA 
It follows that FORMULA  admits sections over any ground field.


Case 4
Consider
FORMULA 
as a complete intersection of three forms FORMULA  and FORMULA  of bidegree FORMULA 
and two additional
forms quadratic in the second factor.
Let FORMULA  be defined by the exact sequence
FORMULA 
for generic FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Even part
Suppose that the additional quadratic forms both have degree FORMULA .
Then FORMULA 
whence
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Example 17 (FORMULA  case)  
Consider the intersection of the forms FORMULA  and FORMULA :
FORMULA 
In this case, we have
FORMULA 
i.e., the space of sections has dimension 18. Furthermore, these all vanish along
the projectivization of the distinguished one-dimensional projective subbundle of FORMULA .
Divisors FORMULA  in FORMULA  are fibered over FORMULA 
in quadrics containing a distinguished line FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  for two divisors in this linear series.

Remark 18 
Since FORMULA  and FORMULA  both contain FORMULA , we have a constant subfamily:
FORMULA 
This provides sections for FORMULA . Note here that FORMULA  is non-minimal,
as FORMULA  can be blown down over the ground field.


Odd part
Suppose that the additional forms have degrees FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Then FORMULA 
whence
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Example 19 (FORMULA  case)  
Retain the notation of Example REF .
Here we let FORMULA  where FORMULA  has bidegree FORMULA .
The image of FORMULA  in FORMULA  lies on
three quadrics, and is in fact a cone over a Segre threefold.
The intersection of FORMULA  with FORMULA  gives two distinguished sections
FORMULA 
which may be conjugate over the ground field.
We shall study this case in Section .


Case 5
Consider
FORMULA 
as a complete intersection of four forms FORMULA  and FORMULA  of bidegree FORMULA 
and two additional
forms quadratic in the second factor.
Let FORMULA  be defined by the exact sequence
FORMULA 
for generic FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Even part
Suppose that the additional quadratic forms both have degree FORMULA .
Then FORMULA 
whence
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Example 20 (FORMULA  case)  
Consider
the intersection of the forms FORMULA  and FORMULA :
FORMULA 
In this case, we have
FORMULA 
and the space of sections has dimension 24. These all vanish along a distinguished section FORMULA ,
corresponding the projectivization of the trivial summand of FORMULA ; let FORMULA  and FORMULA  denote two
of the divisors in this class.
Let FORMULA , which is a quartic del Pezzo fibration.

Remark 21 
The section FORMULA  factors through FORMULA . This canonical section
is defined over any field of scalars.


Odd part
Suppose that the additional forms have degrees FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
Then FORMULA 
whence
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
We can realize the FORMULA  case via constructions similar to Examples REF , REF , REF , and
REF .
Example 22 
We do not have examples of height-two quartic del Pezzo fibrations FORMULA  with smooth total space
and fibers having at worst one ordinary double point.
A direct generalization of the approach in Examples REF , REF , REF , and
REF  yields a pencil of singular del Pezzo surfaces. The bundle corresponding
to the bidegree FORMULA  forms is
FORMULA 
parametrizing quadric hypersurfaces singular along the distinguished section of FORMULA . The corresponding
divisors FORMULA  depend on 9 parameters. The bundle corresponding to bidegree FORMULA  forms is
FORMULA 
parametrizing quadric hypersurfaces containing the distinguished section. The
associated divisor FORMULA  depends on FORMULA  parameters. Altogether, this construction
depends on
FORMULA 
parameters, whereas the expected dimension is two. This reflects the higher cohomology of the
bundle FORMULA .


Structure of height two families
We use the notation of Example REF . Projecting from
the distinguished section FORMULA  gives a rational map
FORMULA 
The image of FORMULA  under this mapping is a smooth, trivial quadric surface
fibration
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  denote the exceptional divisor over FORMULA ; FORMULA  is
a hyperplane section.
The equation of FORMULA  takes the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is linear and FORMULA  and FORMULA  are quadratic. Here
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are homogeneous coordinates on FORMULA , FORMULA 
are homogeneous coordinates on FORMULA , and FORMULA 
is the distinguished section. Thus FORMULA  blows up the curve
FORMULA 
a type FORMULA  curve in FORMULA .
The projection FORMULA  induces FORMULA .
In summary, we have
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
We enumerate sections FORMULA  disjoint from the singular section.
height 0:  The points of
FORMULA 
yield height-zero sections of FORMULA  disjoint from FORMULA .
height 1:  Fix a line FORMULA  from one of the two rulings, which meets FORMULA  in a single point.
The subfamily FORMULA  meets FORMULA  in a single point FORMULA . Curves of bidegree
FORMULA  in FORMULA  containing FORMULA  form a two-parameter family. The proper
transforms of these curves in FORMULA  are sections disjoint from FORMULA . Altogether,
we obtain a three parameter family of sections, birational to FORMULA .
Taking the choice of ruling into account, we obtain two such families.
Given a generic point FORMULA , we exhibit height-one sections
of FORMULA  containing FORMULA . Regard FORMULA  and choose the ruling
so it contains the projection of FORMULA  onto FORMULA .
These are indexed by two copies of FORMULA ,
one for each ruling of FORMULA .
height 2:  Fix a hyperplane section FORMULA , meeting FORMULA  in two points;
FORMULA  meets FORMULA  in FORMULA . Curves of bidegree FORMULA  in FORMULA 
containing FORMULA  form a one-parameter family. This construction gives a
four parameter family of sections of FORMULA , birational to FORMULA .
height 3:  Repeat the same argument for curves of bidegree FORMULA  (twisted
cubics) in FORMULA .
height 4:  Repeat the same argument for curves of bidegree FORMULA  in FORMULA .
Consider nodal rational curves FORMULA  of bidegree FORMULA ,
which meet FORMULA  in four points. Let FORMULA  denote the normalization of FORMULA ; FORMULA  meets
FORMULA  in four points, FORMULA . Consider curves of bidegree FORMULA  in FORMULA 
containing these points. Such curves exist only when we have a projective equivalence
FORMULA 
This leads to the following geometric problem:
Let FORMULA  be a smooth quadric surface, FORMULA  a smooth hyperplane, FORMULA 
prescribed points, and FORMULA  prescribed points.
Describe the morphisms
FORMULA 
of bidegree FORMULA  such that FORMULA  for FORMULA .
These are constructed as follows: For any point FORMULA , there exists a curve of bidegree FORMULA  in FORMULA  with a node
at FORMULA , containing FORMULA , and satisfying the condition on projective equivalence:
Indeed, projection from FORMULA  converts the problem to finding a conic through four given points
in FORMULA  so that the points have prescribed projective equivalence class in the conic.
height 5: The case of bidegree FORMULA  proceeds just as the case of twisted
cubics.
The case of bidegree FORMULA  boils down to the following:
Let FORMULA  be a smooth quadric surface, FORMULA  a smooth hyperplane, FORMULA 
prescribed points, and FORMULA  prescribed points.
Describe the morphisms
FORMULA 
of bidegree FORMULA  such that FORMULA  for FORMULA .
These are constructed as follows: Fix pairs of pointed stable curves
FORMULA 
and let FORMULA  denote the stable curve of genus four obtained by gluing
FORMULA  to FORMULA  for FORMULA . The canonical embedding of FORMULA 
is contained in a quadric surface
FORMULA 
we may assume the components
FORMULA  and FORMULA  have types FORMULA  and FORMULA  respectively.
For any two general points
FORMULA , consider the linear series of curves of type
FORMULA  with assigned basepoints at FORMULA  and FORMULA .
This yields a morphism to a quadric surface
FORMULA 
The image of FORMULA  is a hyperplane class; the image of FORMULA  is of type
FORMULA .
Thus for each collection FORMULA ,
we obtain a two-parameter family of sections FORMULA ,
corresponding to FORMULA  of bidegree FORMULA 
such that

FORMULA ;

FORMULA .

The two parameters reflect the choice of FORMULA  above.
Hence we get a seven-dimensional rational variety parametrizing these
sections.
height 6:
We focus on the case of bidegree FORMULA , which leads to the following
statment:
Let FORMULA  be a smooth quadric surface, FORMULA  a smooth hyperplane, FORMULA 
prescribed points, and FORMULA  a fixed mapping of degree four.
The morphisms
FORMULA 
of bidegree FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
are parametrized by a rational variety.
The rational curves of bidegree FORMULA  through six fixed points depend on FORMULA 
parameters.
This is proved as follows: Let FORMULA  be a smooth projective curve of genus five that is
Brill-Noether general, i.e., not hyperelliptic, trigonal, or a plane quintic. Then the
canonical embedding
FORMULA 
realizes FORMULA  as a complete intersection of three quadrics. In particular, FORMULA  admits
embeddings into a family of quadric del Pezzo surfaces parametrized by
FORMULA . This remains true for certain stable curves, e.g.,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are chosen arbitrarily on each component.
Fixing FORMULA  and FORMULA , let FORMULA  denote one of the
del Pezzo surfaces arising from this construction. The linear series
FORMULA  induces a birational morphism onto a quadric
FORMULA 
The image of FORMULA  is FORMULA  is a hyperplane section; the image of FORMULA  is a bidegree
FORMULA  curve with four nodes.

Structure of height four families
We give additional details about the geometric structure of height
four families. Recall the notation of Example REF .
The generic fiber FORMULA  contains a line FORMULA . Projecting from
this line gives a birational morphism
FORMULA 
blowing down the five lines incident to FORMULA ; FORMULA 
is mapped to the plane conic containing the images of
the five lines.
We interpret this for FORMULA  over FORMULA : Fiberwise projection
from FORMULA  induces a rational map
FORMULA 
inducing a birational morphism
FORMULA 
The image FORMULA  is a
product FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  denote the projections from FORMULA .
We describe the center FORMULA  of FORMULA : It is a rational curve of bidegree FORMULA 
in FORMULA , i.e., projection onto the second factor has degree
five and eight branch points. It follows that
FORMULA 
The composition
FORMULA 
is given by forms of bidegree FORMULA  on FORMULA  vanishing
along FORMULA . Its restriction to FORMULA  has bidegree
FORMULA , thus collapses
FORMULA  onto the first factor.
We enumerate sections of FORMULA  of small height FORMULA , restricting our
attention to sections that dominate FORMULA . For example, we do not consider
sections contained in FORMULA . Furthermore, we subdivide
based on how the sections meet FORMULA  and FORMULA , the exceptional
divisor of FORMULA .
height 0:  The constant sections of FORMULA  induce
a two-parameter family of sections for FORMULA , disjoint
from FORMULA  and FORMULA .
height 1:  Consider sections of FORMULA 
projecting onto a line FORMULA , meeting FORMULA  in FORMULA  with
FORMULA . These depend on three parameters, are
disjoint from FORMULA , but meet FORMULA  twice. These sections
are parametrized by a space fibered over FORMULA , with
generic fiber FORMULA .
height 2:  We have sections of FORMULA 
projecting onto a line FORMULA , meeting FORMULA  at one point. The resulting
sections of FORMULA  depend on four parameters, and meet both FORMULA 
and FORMULA  once.
There are also sections with FORMULA  a plane conic, where the
corresponding curve in FORMULA  meets FORMULA  in four points FORMULA 
with FORMULA . These are birational to FORMULA ;
indeed, there exists a unique plane conic FORMULA 
such that the projective invariant of these four points in  FORMULA equals the
projective invariant of the points FORMULA  in FORMULA .
height 3:  Sections of FORMULA  projecting onto a line and disjoint from FORMULA .
These are parametrized by an open subset FORMULA ;
the generic fiber over a point of FORMULA  is isomorphic to
FORMULA . The resulting sections of
FORMULA  are disjoint from FORMULA  and meet FORMULA  twice.
There are sections of FORMULA  projecting onto a conic, meeting FORMULA  in three points. We have a
unique such section over each conic in FORMULA , so the space of these sections is
birational to FORMULA . The corresponding sections of FORMULA  meet FORMULA  three times and
FORMULA  one.
Sections of FORMULA  projecting onto a nodal cubic curve FORMULA  with normalization FORMULA ;
the corresponding curve in FORMULA  meets FORMULA  in six points FORMULA .
We have the constraint that
FORMULA 
i.e., these are projectively equivalent. Projection from the node of FORMULA  induces a degree-two cover
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  via FORMULA . This translates into the following problem
Fix a degree five morphism FORMULA . Characterize sets of points
FORMULA 
such that there exists some degree-two morphism FORMULA  with
FORMULA 

Note that FORMULA  coincides with projection from the node of FORMULA  and determines
this node uniquely.
This example can be approached using the Brill-Noether analysis employed in
Section . Consider pairs of 6-pointed stable curves
of genus zero
FORMULA 
and let FORMULA  denote the genus-five stable curve obtained by gluing these
together. If FORMULA  is immersed in FORMULA  as the union of a conic and a nodal cubic
FORMULA 
then the canonical curve FORMULA  lies
on a cubic ruled surface, i.e., the blow up of FORMULA  at the node. This is
equivalent to FORMULA  being trigonal, with the FORMULA  given by the rulings.
Trigonal curves are codimension one in the moduli space of curves of
genus five.
The projection of the trigonal curves FORMULA  as above to
FORMULA  is finite onto its image, by a direct
computation with MAPLE. This image is unirational as it is
dominated by FORMULA —the choice of a plane conic
and a plane cubic with a node at a prescribed point.

Structure of height six families
Recall the notation leading into Remark REF . In
particular, we have
FORMULA 
where the image is quadric hypersurface. It contains a distinguished
plane FORMULA .
The divisor
FORMULA  has image FORMULA  isomorphic to
a cone over the Segre threefold FORMULA .
The plane FORMULA  is the cone over FORMULA 
for a point FORMULA .
Since FORMULA  is the intersection of FORMULA  with a quadric hypersurface FORMULA ,
we may interpret it as a double cover of FORMULA  branched over
a divisor of bidegree FORMULA . In particular, FORMULA  is a quadric surface
bundle over FORMULA  with six degenerate fibers, and a conic bundle
over FORMULA , with discriminant a plane quartic FORMULA 
and associated étale double cover FORMULA .
Thus the intermediate Jacobian
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the genus two curve branched over the discriminant
of FORMULA .
Thus in particular, we have
FORMULA 
which reflects the fact that the fibration
FORMULA  has relative Picard rank two.
The morphism FORMULA  is the blow up of FORMULA  along
the curve FORMULA , which coincides with the fiber of
FORMULA  over FORMULA . The fibration
FORMULA 
is induced by the projection from  FORMULA
FORMULA 
We construct a family of sections of FORMULA  mapping
birationally onto FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  denote the projective space dual to the FORMULA 
arising as a factor of the Segre threefold. For each
FORMULA , we have a conic bundle
FORMULA 
degenerate over FORMULA . This conic bundle has eight
FORMULA -curves FORMULA  that induce
sections FORMULA  of FORMULA ;
we obtain a generically finite morphism
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a smooth projective surface compactifying the
space parametrizing FORMULA  as FORMULA  varies. In particular,
there is an open set FORMULA  and a correspondence
FORMULA 
where the vertical arrow is a FORMULA -bundle and the horizontal
arrow is induced by the inclusions
FORMULA .
Now each FORMULA  meets each of the four degenerate fibers of FORMULA 
in one component; these components are indexed by FORMULA .
Note that FORMULA .
Thus we obtain maps
FORMULA 
where the image of FORMULA  lies in the fiber over FORMULA . Thus there is an induced
mapping
FORMULA 
which is clearly birational.
We claim that the fibers of FORMULA  yield sections
of FORMULA , i.e., FORMULA  parametrizes a family of sections
birational to FORMULA . Indeed, fix FORMULA  over FORMULA 
and a fiber FORMULA  for FORMULA .
The point FORMULA  corresponds to a line
FORMULA 
passing through FORMULA .
There is a unique intersection point FORMULA ,
and the fiber FORMULA  meets FORMULA  in
precisely one point.

Structure of height eight families
We return to the example discussed in Remark REF :
Let FORMULA  denote a complete intersection of two quadrics,
FORMULA  a smooth codimension-two linear section, and
FORMULA . The pencil of linear sections containing FORMULA  induced
a del Pezzo fibration
FORMULA 
We review the classical constructions for the lines on FORMULA , following
Miles Reid's thesis {{cite:fc67e26c-9da8-4c66-8480-5b7fb5ce9209}} (see also {{cite:3ac2dc1b-6d52-4782-a165-c23b8901ba64}} and {{cite:5dcd1a50-b72a-4bc2-8bf3-92112c59bf0b}} for
higher-degree curves).
The discriminant divisor restricted to the pencil of quadrics
yields six points on FORMULA , thus determining a genus two
curve FORMULA . Note that the space of maximal isotropic subspaces on
quadrics in the pencil is a FORMULA -bundle over FORMULA ; these
correspond to the conics on FORMULA .
Projecting from a line FORMULA ,
we obtain a morphism
FORMULA 
blowing up FORMULA , realized as a quintic curve in FORMULA .
The space of all lines
FORMULA 
which in turn is isomorphic to the intermediate Jacobian FORMULA .
Thus we conclude
FORMULA 
We examine sections of FORMULA  of low degree.

lines on FORMULA ;

conics on FORMULA  incident to FORMULA ;

twisted cubics on FORMULA  incident to FORMULA  in two points.

The first family is indexed by FORMULA .
The second family has dimension three, thus a priori has a
chance to dominate FORMULA . However, the conics in FORMULA  fail to dominate
FORMULA , so the subfamily we're considering cannot possibly dominate
FORMULA . The family of twisted cubics in FORMULA  is birational to a
Grassmann-bundle over the lines in FORMULA : given FORMULA ,
each subspace
FORMULA 
intersects FORMULA  in the union of FORMULA  and a twisted cubic FORMULA .
Given FORMULA , consider
FORMULA 
which necessarily meets FORMULA  in FORMULA  and FORMULA .
The curves produced in this way are parametrized by
FORMULA 
a FORMULA -bundle over FORMULA .
These one-parameter families of sections sweep out a distinguished
rational curve in FORMULA , the generic fiber of FORMULA .
Fix a pair FORMULA  consisting of

a quadric surface FORMULA ;

a ruling FORMULA  such that FORMULA .

There is a natural bijection between such pairs and elements of
FORMULA . Consider the singular quadric FORMULA  that
is a cone over FORMULA  with vertex FORMULA . The intersection of FORMULA 
with a fiber FORMULA  of FORMULA  consists of FORMULA 
plus a hyperplane section singular at FORMULA .

Structure of height ten families
Let FORMULA  be a
smooth quadric threefold. Consider a pencil of quadrics on FORMULA 
with smooth base locus FORMULA , a canonical curve of genus 5. Thus
we have a del Pezzo fibration
FORMULA 
We assume the fibers have at most one ordinary double point.
Proposition 23 FORMULA  has a family of sections parametrized by a principal
homogeneous space over the Jacobian of FORMULA .

Figure REF  lists numerical possibilities for the
spaces of sections, expressed
in terms of the geometry of the associated curve FORMULA .
FIGURE 
We focus on the latter case, as there are enough free parameters
for the family to dominate FORMULA .
Thus we are left with an enumerative problem:
Fix FORMULA ; then there exists a unique twisted quartic
FORMULA  such that FORMULA .
Consider the linear series FORMULA . Through each collection of seven
points FORMULA  in linear general position
there passes a unique twisted quartic FORMULA . We are interested
in the locus
FORMULA 
The linear system FORMULA  realizes FORMULA  as a plane septic curve with
10 double points FORMULA .
These depend on a total of FORMULA  parameters,
and FORMULA  can be in general position. Consider the image of
FORMULA  under the linear series of quartics through FORMULA ,
i.e., the adjoint linear series. The resulting surface FORMULA  has
degree 6 in FORMULA .
The quadric hypersurface FORMULA  pulls back to a plane curve of degree eight
double at FORMULA . Of course, this contains FORMULA  and the residual curve
is a line in FORMULA . Thus we find
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a twisted quartic in FORMULA .
Now we are essentially done: There exists a family of twisted quartic curves
FORMULA 
whose fibers each meet FORMULA  seven times. The induced mapping
FORMULA 
is birational. However, FORMULA  is a principal homogeneous space
over the Jacobian of FORMULA .
Remark 24 We summarize the geometric structure of the small-degree sections
listed in Figure REF : When FORMULA  these are just points on FORMULA , i.e.,
the constant sections. For FORMULA , we have the lines incident to FORMULA  contained
in FORMULA , a FORMULA -bundle over FORMULA . When FORMULA , we have conics three-secant to
FORMULA , which are birationally parametrized by FORMULA ; indeed, take the
plane spanned by three points on FORMULA  and intersect this with FORMULA .
For FORMULA , we have twisted cubics FORMULA  meeting
FORMULA  in five points, which are birational to a FORMULA -bundle over
FORMULA . Given such a twisted cubic, let
FORMULA  be the hypersurface it spans; it contains a quadric surface
(FORMULA ) and eight distinguished points (FORMULA ) on that surface.
Five of these points are on FORMULA ; three are not.
Thus we have a mapping
FORMULA 
The fiber over FORMULA  consists of pairs
FORMULA 
which is a double cover over FORMULA  via projection onto the first factor. Indeed,
there are two twisted cubics passing through five generic points on a quadric surface.
However, given a pencil of three-planes containing a plane in FORMULA , two elements
will be tangent to a quadric hypersurface FORMULA . Thus the double cover over FORMULA 
is branched in two points, so the fibers of the mapping are rational curves.

Question 25 Where else does this periodic behavior occur for minimal quartic del Pezzo surfaces over
FORMULA ? Can this be analyzed via moduli of vector bundles and Serre's construction?


Structure of families of height twelve
Recall the notation of Example REF . We have
two projections
FORMULA 
and let FORMULA  denote the image of FORMULA  under FORMULA . The canonical
section FORMULA  is contracted under FORMULA  to a double point FORMULA .
The image is a nodal Fano threefold of genus seven and degree twelve.
See {{cite:5f15734e-f957-4b96-baa4-ed077e99151c}} for concrete descriptions of smooth Fano varieties
of this type.
There is an alternate approach to FORMULA : Project FORMULA  from the
distinguished section  FORMULA
FORMULA 
let FORMULA  denote the exceptional divisor.
The resulting fibration
FORMULA 
is a cubic surface fibration containing a constant line FORMULA .
Now projection onto the second factor
FORMULA 
is birational and collapses FORMULA  onto a line FORMULA .
The center of FORMULA  is the union of FORMULA  and a curve FORMULA ,
of genus seven, admitting a line bundle FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
and FORMULA , i.e., a FORMULA ; the divisor FORMULA  is a FORMULA .
Note that FORMULA  and FORMULA  meet in four points FORMULA  and FORMULA ;
the fibers of FORMULA 
are mapped onto the pencil of cubic surfaces cutting out FORMULA .
The birational mapping obtained by composing the inverse of FORMULA ,
the blow up of FORMULA , and  FORMULA
FORMULA 
is induced by the linear series of quartics vanishing along FORMULA .
Note that the intermediate Jacobian FORMULA .
This also has a Prym interpretation: Projecting from FORMULA  fiberwise
allows us to realize FORMULA  as a conic bundle
FORMULA 
with discriminant a genus-eight curve FORMULA  of bidegree FORMULA . If
FORMULA  is the cover arising from the conic bundle then
FORMULA 
This is an instance of the tetragonal construction of Donagi and Recillas
{{cite:0fc3a038-2fa7-44a0-aa66-529ffc53a5d9}}.
We characterize sections of FORMULA  of small degree, using the geometry
sketched above:

the canonical section FORMULA ;

the sections arising from exceptional fibers over points of FORMULA ,
which move in a one-parameter family;

the sections arising from secant lines to FORMULA ,
which are parametrized by FORMULA ;

the sections arising from conics five-secant to FORMULA ,
which are parametrized by FORMULA ;

the sections arising from twisted cubics meeting FORMULA  in eight points,
which are parametrized by FORMULA ; we explain why
this is the case below;

the sections arising from eleven-secant quartic rational curves,
which are parametrized by FORMULA ;

the sections arising from quintic rational curves
14-secant to FORMULA , which are parametrized by FORMULA ;

the sections arising from sextic rational curves
17-secant to FORMULA , which are parametrized by FORMULA .

First the conic case: each triple
of points on FORMULA  spans a plane, whose residual intersection
with FORMULA  consists of five points that uniquely determine a
five-section conic.
We do the cubic case. Given such a section FORMULA  meeting
FORMULA  in FORMULA , there is a three-dimensional vector space of
quadrics cutting out FORMULA , which induces a FORMULA  on FORMULA .
Note that the variety of FORMULA 's on a
genus seven curve is four-dimensional, reflecting the
fact that a FORMULA  is of the form FORMULA 
for FORMULA . This gives a morphism from the
space of sections to FORMULA .
Conversely, suppose we are given generic points FORMULA .
Choose a twisted cubic FORMULA  incident to FORMULA  at two points and containing FORMULA . (The curve FORMULA  is a tri-section of our original del Pezzo
fibration.)
The union FORMULA  has degree 12 and arithmetic genus 15, thus
FORMULA 
and the curve FORMULA  sits on a quartic surface FORMULA .
Note that this generically
has Picard lattice:
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be the residual to FORMULA  in a complete intersection of a
quadric surface and FORMULA ; this is an elliptic quartic curve.
Consider the union FORMULA ; we have
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be residual to FORMULA  in this complete intersection.
Note that
FORMULA 
which gives the desired section.
We turn to the quartic case. First we construct the morphism
from the space of sections to FORMULA . Suppose that
FORMULA  is a rational quartic curve in FORMULA 
meeting FORMULA  in eleven points. Choose a K3 surface
FORMULA  containing FORMULA  and FORMULA , with Picard lattice:
FORMULA 
These exist as
FORMULA 
Now FORMULA  is also contained in a quadric surface FORMULA , generally
unique. Let FORMULA  denote the residual to FORMULA  in FORMULA ,
so that
FORMULA 
The intersection of FORMULA  with FORMULA  gives five points on FORMULA .
We refer the reader to {{cite:1983503d-33b0-4dcd-b817-e877ecdb6e07}} for the inverse construction.
Now for the case of quintic rational curves:
Given six points FORMULA , let FORMULA  denote the unique
twisted cubic in FORMULA  through these points. Consider the
pencil of quartic surfaces containing the union
FORMULA 
each of which has the lattice polarization:
FORMULA 
Consider the residual curve FORMULA  to FORMULA  in this complete intersection;
it has genus zero, degree five, and meets FORMULA  in fourteen points.
Thus FORMULA  corresponds to a section of FORMULA ; these are parametrized
by elements of FORMULA , which may be interpreted as the theta divisor of
FORMULA .
Finally, we turn to the case of sextic rational curves.
We construct the morphism to FORMULA . Suppose that
FORMULA  is 17-secant to FORMULA . The union FORMULA  has
genus 23 and degree 14 so by Riemann-Roch
FORMULA 
and thus is contained in a quartic surface FORMULA . This has Picard
group:
FORMULA 
Consider the elliptic fibration FORMULA ; it has FORMULA  as a section
FORMULA 
Geometrically, this arises from FORMULA  via residuation: A rational
sextic space curve FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 
and thus lies in a cubic surface FORMULA . Then FORMULA  is the residual to FORMULA 
in FORMULA . The intersection of FORMULA  with FORMULA  consists of seven points,
which gives us our point in FORMULA .
This construction is invertible by the following result, proven in
{{cite:1983503d-33b0-4dcd-b817-e877ecdb6e07}}:
Let FORMULA  denote a generic tetragonal curve of genus 7
as above, and FORMULA  generic points. Then there
exists a unique sextic rational curve FORMULA 
and quartic K3 surface FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 

Remark 26 There is a straightforward construction of a family
of sections parametrized by a rationally connected fibration over FORMULA .
Fix FORMULA  and let FORMULA  denote a rational quartic
curve containing these points. Note that the possible such FORMULA 
correspond to ruled quadric surfaces through FORMULA ,
a double cover of FORMULA  branched over a
quartic plane curve, i.e., a degree two del Pezzo surface.
These curves yield five-sections of FORMULA . Using
the argument for Brumer's theorem {{cite:65b0d477-d6af-43da-87a6-b9c2ffdea1fd}}, {{cite:a4e6bdf4-6784-4087-b435-a11c8b25c8de}}, for each such
odd-degree multisection there exists a family of sections, obtained
via a sequence of residuations, and parametrized by a rationally
connected variety.

We summarize the evidence for the existence of sections over generic fibrations of small height
collected so far.

TABLE 


Fibrations of height fourteen to twenty
Let FORMULA  be a generic quartic del Pezzo fibration of height FORMULA .
This corresponds to the following cases of Section :

height 14: Example REF  of Case 4;

height 16: the FORMULA  instance of the even part of Case 3;

height 18: the FORMULA  instance of the odd part of Case 2;

height 20: the FORMULA  instance of the odd part of Case 1.

Then we have
FORMULA 
and we write FORMULA .
We have:

FORMULA  is anticanonically embedded in FORMULA  of degree FORMULA ;

FORMULA  is small, generically contracting
FORMULA  sections of FORMULA  to nodes of FORMULA .

Indeed, the anticanonical divisor of FORMULA  (as computed via adjunction)
coincides with FORMULA .
A direct computation with Bezout's theorem shows that the number of sections
contracted by FORMULA  is as claimed.
(Over non-closed fields, there is no reason for these to be defined over the ground
field.)
In the following sections, we make the geometry even more explicit.
Height fourteen
Recall the notation from Example REF .
The two distinguished sections are denoted FORMULA .
Projection onto the second factor gives
FORMULA 
Note that FORMULA  is a cone over a Segre threefold FORMULA ,
with vertex FORMULA , a line.
The equations of FORMULA  are
given by the FORMULA  minors of the matrix:
FORMULA 
we express
FORMULA 
We may interpret FORMULA  as follows: Fix a fiber
FORMULA  in the Segre threefold, yielding a subspace
FORMULA 
Write
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is quadratic and the FORMULA  are linear.
Note that FORMULA 
is necessarily singular along some line FORMULA ,
and thus has rank at most six;
in suitable coordinates, we have
FORMULA 
where the FORMULA  are linear.
Let FORMULA  denote the residual to FORMULA  in FORMULA , which
is contained in the additional quadric hypersurface
FORMULA 
Suppose that FORMULA  is a cone over a generic fiber
FORMULA  in the Segre threefold; then
FORMULA  and FORMULA  cut out the same quadric hypersurface on FORMULA , i.e.,
FORMULA 
We claim that FORMULA  is a linear section of the Grassmannian FORMULA .
Indeed, let FORMULA  denote the Plücker coordinates
on the Grassmannian and consider the linear section FORMULA .
The Plücker relations specialize to the FORMULA  minors of
FORMULA 
as well as
FORMULA 
Setting
FORMULA 
and FORMULA  and FORMULA ,
we obtain the equations for FORMULA  given above.
In particular, FORMULA  has degree five. Furthermore, a direct
calculation shows that FORMULA  has ordinary double points along FORMULA .
This reflects the fact that the birational morphism FORMULA 
collapses FORMULA  to FORMULA ,
and any small contraction of a smooth variety is singular.
The variety FORMULA  is the intersection of FORMULA  with a generic quadric FORMULA , and thus has degree ten
and two ordinary singularities
FORMULA 
The dualizing sheaf FORMULA , so FORMULA  is a Fano variety with
ordinary double points, and thus a degeneration of a smooth Fano variety
of degree ten and genus six {{cite:b09a3da1-cbb4-479a-a9ef-abcf6fa06aaf}}.
Degenerations with one node are studied in {{cite:3f3a07dc-f173-4bc1-bfc2-3a5da6abc496}}.
We describe the quartic del Pezzo fibration in terms of the geometry of FORMULA . The fibers are obtained by intersecting the subspaces FORMULA  specified
above (associated with the fibers of FORMULA )
with FORMULA  and FORMULA ; note that FORMULA .

Height sixteen
In this case FORMULA  is a complete intersection of three quadrics with four nodes.
These have expected dimension
FORMULA 
which is equal to the expected dimension of the space of quartic del Pezzo fibrations of height sixteen.

Height eighteen
Here FORMULA  is a complete intersection of a quadric and cubic with eight nodes.
These have expected dimension 26,
which is equal to the expected dimension of the space of quartic del Pezzo fibrations of height eighteen.

Height twenty
Here FORMULA  is a quartic threefold with sixteen nodes; however, these
have expected dimension 30, greater than the expected dimension (FORMULA )
of the quartic
del Pezzo fibrations of height twenty.
Consider the Grassmannian FORMULA  parametrizing
quartic del Pezzo surfaces. A generic conic curve in this Grassmannian corresponds to the
rulings of a nonsingular quadric surface in FORMULA .
These can be expressed in equations as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA . In other words
FORMULA 
as a complete intersection of two hypersurfaces of bidegree FORMULA .
These depend on
FORMULA 
parameters.
Let FORMULA  denote the constant sections, corresponding to the solutions
FORMULA 
Projection onto the second factor gives the quartic hypersurface
FORMULA 
with nodes at FORMULA .
There is a second del Pezzo fibration
FORMULA 
constructed as follows. Fix a fiber FORMULA  and its image
FORMULA . The linear series of quadrics vanishing at FORMULA  gives
a mapping FORMULA , whose fibers are also del Pezzo surfaces of degree four.
This is a morphism where FORMULA  is Cartier, i.e., away
from FORMULA .
There exists a small resolution FORMULA  such that the induced
FORMULA 
is a morphism. We obtain FORMULA  from FORMULA  by flopping each of
FORMULA .
Finally, let FORMULA  denote the blow up of FORMULA  at each of
the FORMULA , which coincides with the closure of the graph of the
birational mapping FORMULA ; the induced morphism
FORMULA 
has genus five canonical curves as fibers.
Projecting from one of the FORMULA , we obtain a conic bundle
FORMULA 
branched along a curve FORMULA  of bidegree FORMULA , of genus 16.
The Prym variety therefore has dimension 15; see also {{cite:69b0fec3-410e-4f28-bdff-04ebb6cfdb5c}},
where the non-rationality of a generic FORMULA  is established.
