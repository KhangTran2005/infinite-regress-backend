In this paper we clarify the nature of FORMULA  and FORMULA  electron excitations in pristine
graphene. We clearly demonstrate the continuous transition from single particle to collective
character of such excitations and how screening modifies their dispersion relations. We prove that FORMULA  and FORMULA  plasmons do exist in graphene,
though occurring only for a particular range of wavevectors and with finite damping rate. The particular attention is paid to compare the theoretical results with available EELS measurements in optical (FORMULA ) and other (FORMULA ) limits. The conclusions, based on microscopic numerical results, are confirmed in an approximate analytical approach.
 Introduction
Plasmon spectra of a pristine single layer graphene were first obtained in Ref. {{cite:363e44ef-f4c0-410d-b166-b4433fedf152}}, where the authors observed two distinct structures which they attributed to the so-called FORMULA  and FORMULA  plasmons. They observed that these two plasmonic modes were redshifted in comparison to the corresponding modes in the bulk graphite {{cite:47e92967-d9fe-442d-94b6-5bd83cf13938}}, {{cite:842f2640-41a0-402b-af28-a4e985f157a6}}, {{cite:038abba4-0a3b-48f0-a1fc-d1a3047ed89b}}, due to the reduction of macroscopic screening when going from graphite to graphene {{cite:d0c01781-22ff-4fa7-9d90-51a80963d501}}. The early momentum-dependent theoretical and experimental measurements observed linear dispersion of this FORMULA  plasmon in graphene {{cite:760b74ba-9388-4be0-86e9-599f007fd308}}, {{cite:caafec83-e4c7-49f6-9a04-5f29bd11c604}}, {{cite:6b51bc04-9600-4833-9233-bdc24347f2fb}}, {{cite:52d65598-4f28-4e33-8c68-c1f93510716b}}, which differs from the FORMULA  dispersion reported in graphite {{cite:d0c01781-22ff-4fa7-9d90-51a80963d501}}, {{cite:47e92967-d9fe-442d-94b6-5bd83cf13938}}, {{cite:842f2640-41a0-402b-af28-a4e985f157a6}}, {{cite:e0160ce4-cb3b-49be-801d-dfef6d122f38}}.
Recently a resolute claim was made {{cite:5884f99a-ea0f-4e0c-92c7-6e269ae67b95}} that the previously accepted attribution of the two strong structures in
the graphene excitation spectra was wrong, and the FORMULA  and FORMULA  plasmons are in fact strong single particle (SP) FORMULA  and FORMULA  excitations, respectively, with a characteristic FORMULA  excitation energy dependence. Another group {{cite:c226faa8-558c-4575-b48c-16bebda7dddb}} found strong evidence for 2D plasmon character of FORMULA  and FORMULA  electron excitations, based on the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) experiment showing the FORMULA  dependent dispersion. Even taking into account possible uncertainties arising from experimental difficulties in EELS measurements for low Q values, it is obvious that this apparent controversy deserves to be analysed and resolved.
In this paper we solve this problem using both a numerical method and analytic arguments, providing a rigorous method of determining collective vs. single particle excitation character in solids, and apply it to analyse FORMULA  and FORMULA  electron excitations in a self-supporting monolayer of pristine graphene. We find that the character of FORMULA  (and FORMULA ) transition changes, depending on the wavevector Q. For small FORMULA  these are unscreened single particle transitions, but with increasing Q they acquire collective character as the dynamical screening mechanism becomes more efficient. This explains the gradual change from the QFORMULA  dependence of excitation energies near FORMULA  to the quasi-linear dependence at larger Q. And finally, for even larger Q the collective nature of this modes in graphene is suppressed and they again emerge as the single particle excitations. Same kind of dispersion is observed in {{cite:b23e0ec7-a06c-4e51-a29f-75f41191b0de}}, {{cite:a150f9bd-ef38-4068-a6bc-0c6495521829}}, {{cite:b294c29c-c403-4a29-aed8-1fac1606e32c}}, but the authors did not analyse it in detail. Although the described dispersion seems like the characteristic FORMULA  dependence of the 2D plasmon, we show that this cannot be true because of the complex nature of this mode.
The described analysis is quite general, and its application to graphene provides a very nice illustration how an electronic process can change its character from an interband single particle transition to a collective mode as the dynamical screening takes over with the increasing wavevector FORMULA .
In Sec.  we describe the derivation of the electronic excitation spectra FORMULA  in terms of the dielectric tensor FORMULA , using the method of Ref. {{cite:4c1ff974-3d23-41f2-8558-60a86aee53b4}}, and define the dynamical screening factor FORMULA . In Sec.  we calculate numerically the macroscopic dielectric functions FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA , as well as the dynamical screening factor FORMULA , and discuss the excitation spectra. In Sec.  we summarize the results and their relation to previous experimental and theoretical work.

 Formulation of the problem
The first part of the calculation consists of determining the Kohn-Sham (KS) ground state of graphene and the corresponding wave functions and energies. For the unit cell constant we use the experimental value of FORMULA  {{cite:3cd64e95-aa4c-404d-aa5e-a06a4fe2c96e}}, and we separate the graphene layers with the distance FORMULA . For calculating KS wave functions and energies we use a plane-wave self-consistent field DFT code (PWSCF) within the QUANTUM ESPRESSO (QE) package {{cite:054cf366-81bf-4148-a815-139a153a6da4}}. The core-electron interaction was approximated by the norm-conserving pseudopotentials {{cite:4b5ec3f2-d401-48f2-aed4-b96945d92da1}}, and the exchange correlation (XC) potential by the Perdew-Zunger local density approximation (LDA) {{cite:d3a155aa-ac0c-485e-8cb8-4a714ee6920e}}. To calculate the ground state electronic density we use FORMULA  Monkhorst-Pack K-point mesh of the first Brillouin zone (BZ) and for the plane-wave cut-off energy we choose 50 Ry.
Using the wave functions and energies obtained in the described way we perform the calculation of the electronic excitation spectra within the random phase approximation (RPA). In the quasi-2D systems such as graphene, with the electronic density in the region FORMULA , the spectral function of electronic excitations can be defined as {{cite:4c1ff974-3d23-41f2-8558-60a86aee53b4}}
FORMULA 
where the dielectric matrix in the RPA is given by
FORMULA 
The noninteracting charge-charge response function is given in matrix form as
FORMULA 
The FORMULA  is the normalization volume, FORMULA  is the normalization surface and FORMULA  is the Fermi-Dirac distribution at FORMULA . In this summation we use FORMULA  K-mesh sampling and up to 70 electronic bands. For the broadening parameter FORMULA  we use 0.05 eV.
Matrix elements in (REF ) have the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the momentum transfer vector parallel to the FORMULA -FORMULA  plane, FORMULA  are 3D reciprocal lattice vectors and FORMULA  is a 3D position vector. Wave functions FORMULA  are KS wave functions from the ground state calculation and FORMULA  are the corresponding energies.
FIGURE 
In this approach the superlattice consists of periodically repeated layers of graphene such that the charge densities of adjacent layers do not overlap. We restrict our consideration to one layer placed in the region FORMULA , where the interaction with the adjacent layers is avoided by allowing Coulomb interaction between charge oscillations only within this region. This is done by integrating the Dyson equation for FORMULA  within the limits of FORMULA  {{cite:4c1ff974-3d23-41f2-8558-60a86aee53b4}}, {{cite:af9769b9-83b1-4113-9ba1-7747ecd232da}}, {{cite:013c8c10-95ef-4f80-b3e1-f34ad9fc0b66}}. The resulting Coulomb interaction matrix elements have the explicit form
FORMULA 
with
FORMULA 
Similar approach was also carried out for layered structures in Ref. {{cite:904f71dd-9e73-46e6-9297-f8ab35adc5b4}}.
In our analysis of electronic excitation spectra we will use the macroscopic dielectric function which is defined as
FORMULA 
and includes the crystal local field effects in the perpendicular, though not in the parallel direction. By this we mean that we put FORMULA , while leaving the reciprocal lattice vectors in FORMULA  direction, FORMULA , which is justified by the fact that the parallel local field effects are not so important for describing the surface plasmons {{cite:9bdfa01e-3289-41d1-a68b-d3692d0ae6cf}}. To get a well converged spectra we use 71 FORMULA  vectors.
With this macroscopic dielectric function the spectral function (REF ) can be written as
FORMULA 
where we have defined the dynamical screening factor FORMULA  and simplified the notation with FORMULA  and FORMULA . For a vanishing screening in the system we have that FORMULA , while for the screened FORMULA . In the first case the spectral function S is equal to FORMULA  and all the structures in spectra have purely SP character.
FIGURE 
To analyse the electronic excitation spectrum of a 2D material one can also use the dielectric function within the tight-binding approximation (TBA) {{cite:4a4e559b-1e5f-4002-9965-11e20cb21bec}}, {{cite:6a8af4b4-2cd6-428c-bcf1-be1f7f5c4eca}}, {{cite:b9f943a0-2f57-4df3-9c74-de8e594768b0}}. Instead of the KS wave functions and energies, here one uses the states and energies of the TBA hamiltonian. If we consider graphene beyond the Dirac cone approximation then the 2D charge-charge response function is given by
FORMULA 
where the band index FORMULA  represents the occupied FORMULA  band and FORMULA  the unoccupied FORMULA  band in graphene. For the numerical calculation of (REF ) we use FORMULA  K-point mesh and the broadening parameter FORMULA . The TBA band energies are FORMULA  with the hopping parameter FORMULA  {{cite:8dd534ab-43fb-489a-8464-0449fc801d69}}, {{cite:03640535-a924-4b3f-8d0e-b316cdcc32c6}}, while the hopping function is given by
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the lattice constant of graphene. Here the spectral function is also defined as in (REF ) and
(REF ), but the dielectric function does not have crystal local field effects included and can be written as
FORMULA 

 Results and discussion
In order to better understand the spectrum of SP electronic excitations we will first analyze the graphene band structure. Fig. REF  shows the graphene band structure along the FORMULA  (black lines) and FORMULA  (blue lines) directions of the BZ, which are relevant directions when the wavevector of external perturbation, Q, is in the FORMULA  direction. We see that FORMULA  electrons exhibit two different kinds of interband transitions. The first is attributed to transitions between two almost dispersionless FORMULA  bands along the FORMULA  direction, as denoted by black thick arrow in Fig. REF . The second kind of FORMULA  interband transitions are attributed to transitions along the FORMULA  direction, as denoted by a
thick blue arrow in Fig. REF . We shall see that the FORMULA  plasmon can be formed from the latter transitions when they are dynamically screened. Two other transitions are between occupied and unoccupied FORMULA  bands. They can be divided into FORMULA  and FORMULA  transitions {{cite:77a42c7f-185b-49c5-9c4e-b4843b75a813}}, as denoted by thin blue and black arrows in Fig. REF . Moreover, the FORMULA  and FORMULA  plasmons, usually treated as one FORMULA  plasmon, originate from these transitions.
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
Fig. REF  shows numerical results for FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  for six different values of Q chosen in the FORMULA  direction of the BZ. For small Q values we can notice the absence of screening, i.e. FORMULA , for almost all FORMULA  values.
Pronounced peaks at FORMULA  and FORMULA  correspond to FORMULA  and FORMULA  transitions, respectively, around the M point of BZ. As we can see, at these energies the screening factor FORMULA  is exactly 1. This means that the mentioned transitions are not screened, i.e. the peaks in FORMULA  are pure SP excitations which appear at the same energies as peaks in FORMULA  {{cite:5884f99a-ea0f-4e0c-92c7-6e269ae67b95}}, {{cite:4a4e559b-1e5f-4002-9965-11e20cb21bec}}. Blue dots in Figs. REF a and REF b show the energies of the peaks in FORMULA , and red dots the energies of the peaks in FORMULA  as functions of the wavevector Q. Blue points show characteristic FORMULA  dispersion of FORMULA  and FORMULA  SP transitions. It can be clearly seen that for small Q peaks in FORMULA  and peaks in FORMULA  coincide and follow the same FORMULA  dependence which confirms their SP character. This quadratic dispersion of SP excitations is a result of the FORMULA  and FORMULA  band structure around the saddle point M, as sketched in Fig. REF . As Q increases the screening factor FORMULA  increases, enhancing the spectral weight of the peaks and moving them to higher energies, i.e. away from the initial FORMULA  and FORMULA  energies (Figs. REF b,c). This is also visible in Figs. REF a and REF b which represent the gradual modification of the initial SP transitions into collective excitations as the dynamical screening becomes more efficient. In this regime (FORMULA ) one can with confidence treat these excitations as FORMULA  and FORMULA  plasmons, though their broad spectral shapes indicate the presence of Landau damping.
Diamonds in Fig. REF a show the energies of FORMULA  plasmon peaks in the measured spectra {{cite:c226faa8-558c-4575-b48c-16bebda7dddb}}. We see very nice agreement with our theoretical calculation throughout the whole energy region. Therefore, the pronounced spectral structures which appear for FORMULA  (e.g. in optical absorption spectra) have purely SP character, while spectral structures which appear for finite Q (e.g. in EELS) represent collective excitations or plasmons.
For FORMULA  the screening becomes most efficient and FORMULA  approaches its lowest value.
Accordingly, in Fig. REF a we can see the largest shift of the FORMULA  plasmon energy compared to the FORMULA  transition energy.
For even higher wavevectors Q this shift becomes smaller, the plasmon energy slowly approaches the unscreened FORMULA  transition energies, but the shape of the plasmon peak remains almost unchanged (Figs. REF e and REF f).
These effects can also be observed in Fig. REF  which shows energy dependence of the real part of the dielectric function obtained with DFT-RPA and TB-RPA methods. In the TB-RPA approximation where only FORMULA  electrons participate in the screening FORMULA  crosses zero for all Q above some minimum value where the resulting dispersion relation reaches the SP continuum, as shown in Fig. REF c. So, it is obvious that the FORMULA  electrons in TB-RPA for higher Q's behave like a 2D electron gas showing the FORMULA  dispersion relation. However, for FORMULA  the excitation energy approaches the finite value at the upper boundary of the FORMULA  continuum (FORMULA ) with the FORMULA  dependence (red curve in Fig. REF c), and does not follow the FORMULA  line to zero (orange curve in Fig. REF c). The reason for this is high interband Landau damping and general reduction of macroscopic screening for finite systems in the low Q region {{cite:d0c01781-22ff-4fa7-9d90-51a80963d501}}, {{cite:24de9229-564a-479b-99d5-8ef98a6c7aa9}}. This is all in qualitative agreement with our resluts, but we can conclude that FORMULA  dispersion is obtained only if we neglect other electronic transitions in graphene. So in the DFT-RPA calculation, including full graphene band structure, i.e. FORMULA  electrons, a number of zeros of FORMULA  is strongly reduced, and if we further include finite lattice effects, i.e. LFE, FORMULA  never cross zero in the whole FORMULA  range (Fig. REF ). The spectra still shows well defined though broader peaks, but the plasmon energies are in a much better agreement with the experimental results than the TB-RPA calculation. Also, for very large Q the FORMULA  plasmon energy should approach the SP FORMULA  transition energy, which is not achieved in TB-RPA.
It might seem that our TB-RPA results qualitatively agree with the theoretical interpretation of the measured data in Ref. {{cite:c226faa8-558c-4575-b48c-16bebda7dddb}}. There the authors demonstrated that the graphene FORMULA  plasmons represent the in-plane charge density oscillations which led them to the conclusion that they behave like plasmons in a 2D electron gas with FORMULA  dispersion relation. Now we clearly
see that this conclusion is indeed partially true, but at the same time we see its limitations. First of all, even the TB-RPA results confirm FORMULA  dispersion only for bigger Q's, while
the authors missed the fact that for small Q's it shows a FORMULA  dependence. This is due to absence of dynamical screening and collective mode changes its character to single particle
excitations. Possible reason for this failure is because the first measured nonzero Q point is at FORMULA  (or FORMULA ) above the
FORMULA  region, as can be clearly seen by observing the authors results in Fig. REF a. So after inclusion of all other points, for FORMULA , one gets the impression that
the dispersion has a square root behavior.
Apart from these deviations for small Q's there are other arguments which violate this simple 2D plasma attribution. As we already mentioned, the inclusion of realistic crystal and band structure (FORMULA  bands and LFE) substantially modifies the TB-RPA FORMULA  dispersion which for bigger Q's even becomes linear. This is also confirmed
by the excellent agreement of our DFT-RPA dispersion and the experimental data shown in Fig. REF a.
The dispersion of the so-called FORMULA  plasmon is more complicated, as visible in Figs. REF  and REF b. There are in fact not one, but two modes, one originating from FORMULA  transitions (FORMULA  plasmon) and the other from FORMULA  transitions (FORMULA  plasmon), as shown in Fig. REF . For low Q values their dispersion is shown in Fig. REF b, together with energies of unscreened SP transitions. While they generally follow the behaviour described above for FORMULA  plasmons, from SP excitations to the Landau damped plasmons and back, they give much broader structures, and furthermore there are additional features arising from their mutual interference. For small Q FORMULA  excitation dominates in intensity, but around FORMULA  it becomes modified by FORMULA  transitions which gain spectral weight, so the high energy spectra of graphene are dominated by FORMULA  plasmons. For large FORMULA  values the spectra again show unscreened SP excitations.
Therefore, as for the FORMULA  plasmon, in Ref. {{cite:c226faa8-558c-4575-b48c-16bebda7dddb}} the authors make a hasty conclusion about
the FORMULA  dispersion of FORMULA  plasmon, also not taking into account that two kinds of FORMULA  excitations exist close in energy and influence each other. In experimental papers Ref. {{cite:b23e0ec7-a06c-4e51-a29f-75f41191b0de}}, {{cite:a150f9bd-ef38-4068-a6bc-0c6495521829}} the authors also obtained FORMULA  plasmon dispersion relation which is in accordance with our theoretical results and conclusions, however they are also prone to describe it as FORMULA  behaviour, with a help of the hydrodinamic model {{cite:43b2acca-aab0-4054-b184-43bbe390bccb}}, {{cite:531ef83a-1707-4034-a006-fca7f99d4d29}}.
Our above analysis partially agrees with the results recently published in Ref. {{cite:5884f99a-ea0f-4e0c-92c7-6e269ae67b95}}, though not entirely, since its authors claim that the FORMULA  and FORMULA  plasmons in graphene do not exist at all. Namely, they derived their conclusions by analysing the dielectric function in the FORMULA  (optical) limit which is indeed the region where the FORMULA  and FORMULA  excitations behave as unscreened SP transitions. However, as we showed, this is not the case for higher Q's. One of the methods to demonstrate that FORMULA  and FORMULA  excitations represent self-sustaining charge density oscillations is to induce them by some external perturbation and see how they behave. If these charge oscillations survive at least one period, after the perturbation is being switched off, then they represent collective modes. In Ref. {{cite:af9769b9-83b1-4113-9ba1-7747ecd232da}} the charge density oscillations in graphene are driven by suddenly created point charge. The authors have identified two periods of oscillations whose frequencies are associated with FORMULA  and FORMULA  plasmon frequencies. In Ref. {{cite:013c8c10-95ef-4f80-b3e1-f34ad9fc0b66}} the charge density in graphene is driven by a point charge moving with constant velocity parallel to the graphene surface. There appear several rows of bow waves whose wavelength, depending on the speed of the point charge, was associated with the excitations of FORMULA  or FORMULA  plasmons. These two observations undoubtedly confirm that FORMULA  and FORMULA  plasmons indeed exist.
A brief analytic discussion could help to clarify the shape of numerically calculated spectra. The spectrum
FORMULA 
in the absence of screening (FORMULA ) will have maxima at the energies of FORMULA  and FORMULA  SP transitions, as in Fig. REF a, with FORMULA  dispersion coming from the shape of the FORMULA  and FORMULA  bands. As the screening term FORMULA  increases with larger Q, these SP peaks will be enhanced and shifted to the maxima FORMULA  of this term, given by the condition
FORMULA 
or explicitly
FORMULA 
where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to FORMULA . This systematic transition from the SP peaks to the maxima of the screening function can be seen in Figs. REF b-REF f, and are the proof of the increasingly collective character of these excitations for higher Q. At the same time the dispersion deviates from the initial FORMULA  dependence, as seen in Figs. REF a and REF b. From (REF ) we can explicitly see that the peak positions are not given by the condition
FORMULA 
as would be expected for an ideal collective mode, and indeed, in our full calculation including LFE (REF ) is not satisfied for any FORMULA . Nevertheless we find broad but well defined spectral peaks corresponding to plasmons in graphene, though restricted to the region of finite wavevectors and Landau damped. We can also derive the condition (REF ) assuming that the spectrum (REF ) has a resonant form, with the maximum at the complex pole of the dielectric function:
FORMULA 
by expanding around FORMULA  with FORMULA .
Dielectric function near the resonance energies FORMULA  shows an interesting behaviour. By inspection of numerical results for finite Q we see
FORMULA 
which is also in agreement with the condition (REF ), valid in the resonance or plasmon region. So the properties (REF ) can be connected with the collective character of the excitations in this region.

 Conclusion
In this paper we have presented the method to determine the character of electronic excitations in solids and applied it to the FORMULA  and FORMULA  electron excitations in a single layer of pristine graphene. Analysing the energy and momentum dependence of the dielectric function components, which determine the excitation spectra, and especially the dynamical screening factor FORMULA , we have demonstrated that FORMULA  and FORMULA  transitions show two types of behaviour. For small wavevector FORMULA  they indeed behave like pure interband (SP) transitions, because the screening is completely absent, but as Q increases and the screening becomes prominent, they rather suddenly acquire a collective character. In this Q region one can indeed say that FORMULA  and FORMULA  plasmons exist in graphene, though they are always Landau damped and appear as broad structures in the spectra.
We also demonstrated that because of strong Landau damping, the dielectric function never crosses zero, even in the region of collective
excitations. These conclusions, based on exact numerical results, are also confirmed by a brief analytic discussion.
We have partially confirmed the seemingly conflicting results of Ref. {{cite:5884f99a-ea0f-4e0c-92c7-6e269ae67b95}} and Refs. {{cite:c226faa8-558c-4575-b48c-16bebda7dddb}}, {{cite:a150f9bd-ef38-4068-a6bc-0c6495521829}}. The claim in {{cite:5884f99a-ea0f-4e0c-92c7-6e269ae67b95}} that FORMULA  and FORMULA  excitations are unscreened SP transitions is indeed correct in the low Q region. This result is expected because in 2D materials, like graphene, macroscopic screening
FORMULA  is significantly reduced in comparison with the bulk system like graphite {{cite:d0c01781-22ff-4fa7-9d90-51a80963d501}}, {{cite:24de9229-564a-479b-99d5-8ef98a6c7aa9}}.
Our results agree very well with the experimental data of Ref. {{cite:c226faa8-558c-4575-b48c-16bebda7dddb}}, however we partially disagree that FORMULA  and FORMULA  electrons behave as 2D electrons
with FORMULA  dispersion relation. We showed that FORMULA  and FORMULA  excitations change their character: in FORMULA  region they have SP character with FORMULA  dispersion, as Q increases they acquire collective character with FORMULA  like dispersion, and for even higher Q's they again acquire SP
character with linear dispersion. In this way we have presented a complete description of this quite intriguing and previously controversial problem, explaining the changing character of electronic excitations in graphene.
By presenting our conclusions we would like to emphasize once again the importance of the in-depth interpretation of experimental measurements and how they relate to the theoretical results. So, to understand the nature of plasmon dispersion it is crucial to perform measurements for all values of the wavevector Q (e.g. with optical absorption spectra and EELS) and to give a careful theoretical interpretation in each of the limits (i.e. FORMULA  and FORMULA ).
