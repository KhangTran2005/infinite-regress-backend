The supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model offers a promising
cold dark matter candidate, the lightest neutralino. I will review the
phenomenological and cosmological constraints on the
supersymmetric parameter space and discuss the prospects for the detection
of this candidate in both accelerator and direct detection searches.
Introduction
It is well known that supersymmetric models with conserved FORMULA -parity
contain one new stable particle which is a candidate for cold dark matter
(CDM) {{cite:66c58ace-d6bb-48b7-be29-ca7250b6ee6e}}. There are very strong constraints, however, forbidding the existence of stable or
long lived particles which are not color and electrically neutral.
Strong and electromagnetically interacting LSPs would become bound with
normal matter forming anomalously heavy isotopes. Indeed, there are very
strong upper limits on the abundances, relative to hydrogen, of nuclear
isotopes {{cite:a37231a8-8b3f-4d87-8055-b5d0b533d772}},

 FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA m  FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA n/nH  FORMULAFORMULA 10-10FORMULA m FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA m FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA There are four neutralinos, each of which is a
linear combination of the FORMULA , neutral fermions {{cite:66c58ace-d6bb-48b7-be29-ca7250b6ee6e}}: the wino
FORMULA , the partner of the
3rd component of the FORMULA  gauge boson;
the bino, FORMULA , the partner of the FORMULA  gauge boson;
and the two neutral Higgsinos, FORMULA  and FORMULA .
In general,
neutralinos can be expressed as a linear combination
FORMULA 
The solution for the coefficients FORMULA  and FORMULA 
for neutralinos that make up the LSP
can be found by diagonalizing the mass matrix
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are the soft supersymmetry breaking
U(1) (SU(2)) gaugino mass terms. FORMULA  is the supersymmetric Higgs
mixing mass parameter and since there are two Higgs doublets in
the MSSM, there are two vacuum expectation values, FORMULA  and FORMULA . One
combination of these is related to the FORMULA  mass, and therefore is not a
free parameter, while the other combination, the ratio of the two vevs,
FORMULA , is free.
The most general version of the MSSM, despite its minimality in particles and
interactions contains well over a hundred new parameters. The study of such a model
would be untenable were it not for some (well motivated) assumptions.
These have to do with the parameters associated with supersymmetry breaking.
It is often assumed that, at some unification scale, all of the gaugino masses
receive a common mass, FORMULA . The gaugino masses at the weak scale are
determined by running a set of renormalization group equations.
Similarly, one often assumes that all scalars receive a common mass, FORMULA ,
at the GUT scale (though one may wish to make an exception for the Higgs
soft masses). These too are run down to the weak scale. The remaining
supersymmetry breaking parameters are the trilinear mass terms, FORMULA ,
which I will also assume are unified at the GUT scale, and the bilinear
mass term
FORMULA . There are, in addition, two physical CP violating phases which will
not be considered here.
The natural boundary conditions at the GUT scale for the MSSM would
include
FORMULA , the two soft Higgs masses (FORMULA  and FORMULA ) and FORMULA  in addition to
FORMULA ,
FORMULA , and FORMULA . In this case, by running the RGEs down to a low energy
scale, one would predict the values of FORMULA , FORMULA , and the Higgs
pseudoscalar mass, FORMULA  (in addition to all of the sparticle masses).
Since FORMULA  is known, it is more useful to analyze supersymmetric models
where FORMULA  is input rather than output. It is also common to treat
FORMULA  as an input parameter. This can be done at the expense of
shifting FORMULA  (up to a sign) and FORMULA  from inputs to outputs.
When the supersymmetry breaking Higgs soft masses are also unified at the
GUT scale (and take the common value FORMULA ), the model is often referred
to as the constrained MSSM or CMSSM. Once these parameters are set, the
entire spectrum of sparticle masses at the weak scale can be calculated.

The Relic Density
The relic abundance of LSP's is
determined by solving
the Boltzmann
equation for the LSP number density in an expanding Universe.
The technique {{cite:ffb6ce67-5420-42bd-801f-287514b30b13}} used is similar to that for computing
the relic abundance of massive neutrinos {{cite:769c3a9d-cff0-4bd2-a1fb-a150f164842e}}.
The relic density depends on additional parameters in the MSSM beyond FORMULA , and FORMULA . These include the sfermion masses, FORMULA , as well as FORMULA , all derived from FORMULA , FORMULA , and
FORMULA . To determine the relic density it is necessary to obtain the
general annihilation cross-section for neutralinos. In much of the
parameter space of interest, the LSP is a bino and the annihilation
proceeds mainly through sfermion exchange. Because of the p-wave
suppression associated with Majorana fermions, the s-wave part of the
annihilation cross-section is suppressed by the outgoing fermion masses.
This means that it is necessary to expand the cross-section to include
p-wave corrections which can be expressed as a term proportional to the
temperature if neutralinos are in equilibrium. Unless the neutralino mass
happens to lie near near a pole, such as FORMULA 
FORMULA  or FORMULA , in which case there are large contributions to the
annihilation through direct FORMULA -channel resonance exchange, the dominant
contribution to
the FORMULA  annihilation cross section comes from crossed
FORMULA -channel sfermion exchange.
Annihilations in the early
Universe continue until the annihilation rate
FORMULA  drops below the expansion rate given by the Hubble parameter,
FORMULA . For particles which annihilate through approximate weak scale interactions, this
occurs when FORMULA . Subsequently, the relic density of neutralinos is
fixed relative to the number of relativistic particles.
As noted above, the number density of neutralinos is tracked by a
Boltzmann-like equation,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the equilibrium number density of neutralinos.
By defining the quantity FORMULA , we can rewrite this equation in
terms of FORMULA , as
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom.
The solution to this equation at late times (small FORMULA ) yields a constant value of
FORMULA , so that FORMULA .
The final relic density expressed as a fraction of the critical energy density
can be written as {{cite:66c58ace-d6bb-48b7-be29-ca7250b6ee6e}}
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  accounts for the subsequent reheating of the
photon temperature with respect to FORMULA , due to the annihilations of
particles with mass FORMULA  {{cite:ea3bb06b-35b0-4071-bb51-122cbcdd42d9}}. The subscript FORMULA  refers to
values at freeze-out, i.e., when annihilations cease. The coefficients FORMULA  and FORMULA 
are related to the partial wave expansion of the cross-section, FORMULA . Eq. (REF  ) results in a very good approximation to the relic density
expect near s-channel annihilation poles, thresholds and in regions where the LSP is
nearly degenerate with the next lightest supersymmetric particle
{{cite:07eeaa0b-b048-42c9-9594-4031a0f1e6db}}.
The preferred range of the relic LSP density is provided by data on
the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which have recently been used to
obtain the following 95% confidence range: FORMULA  {{cite:96eab5e3-a906-4904-87d3-d837495c1c57}}. Values much smaller than
FORMULA  seem to be disfavoured by earlier analyses
of structure formation in the CDM framework, so we restrict our attention
to FORMULA . However, one should note that the LSP
may not constitute all the CDM, in which case
FORMULA  could be reduced below this value. On the upper side,
it is preferable to remain very conservative, in particular because the
upper limit on
FORMULA  sets the upper limit for the sparticle mass scale.
Here,
FORMULA  is used, while being aware that the lower
part of this range currently appears the most plausible.
Fig. REF  illustrates qualitatively the regions of the
FORMULA  plane favoured by LEP limits, particularly on FORMULA , FORMULA  and cosmology. Electroweak symmetry breaking is not
possible in the dark-shaded triangular region in the top left corner, and
the lightest supersymmetric particle would be charged in the bottom right
dark-shaded triangular region. The experimental constraints on FORMULA  and
FORMULA  exert pressures from the left, as indicated,
which depend on the value of FORMULA  and the sign of FORMULA . The
indication of a deviation from the Standard Model in FORMULA 
disfavours FORMULA  and large values of FORMULA  and FORMULA  for FORMULA . The region where
FORMULA  falls within the preferred range is indicated in light shading,
its exact shape being dependent on the value of FORMULA . As
discussed later in more detail, in addition to the `bulk' region at low
FORMULA  and FORMULA , there are a number of regions at large values
of FORMULA  and/or FORMULA  where the relic density is still compatible
with the cosmological constraints. At large values of FORMULA , the
lighter stau, becomes nearly degenerate with the neutralino and
coannihilations between these particles must be taken into
account {{cite:e656a5db-30b9-48f7-bef4-b29293f3c705}}, {{cite:6ab6a382-b174-4e58-8d68-ce7ac5e9e485}}. For non-zero values of FORMULA , there are new
regions for which FORMULA  coannihilations are
important {{cite:1703ee2e-fbab-473c-a950-55f8fb75e414}}. At large FORMULA , as one increases
FORMULA , the pseudo-scalar mass, FORMULA  begins to drop so that there is
a wide funnel-like region (at all values of FORMULA ) such that FORMULA  and s-channel annihilations become
important {{cite:adddee5e-da6b-46e7-8a31-9e360bf1d6dd}}, {{cite:8c430a9c-6cb0-45e9-ac1b-82b4a4622c5c}}. Finally, there is a region at very high
FORMULA  where the value of FORMULA  begins to fall and the LSP becomes more
Higgsino-like. This is known as the `focus point'
region {{cite:55b90259-0639-45a6-9dd3-1e20a2734c01}}. Also shown are the position of several
benchmark points chosen for detailed phenomenological study
{{cite:92ce8074-3232-4e12-91d5-a295d274e62d}}.
FIGURE 
Let us first focus on the `bulk' region in the CMSSM for FORMULA  and FORMULA  shown in Fig. REF  {{cite:e656a5db-30b9-48f7-bef4-b29293f3c705}}. The light
shaded region correspond to
 FORMULA. The dark shaded region has FORMULA 
and is excluded. The light dashed contours
indicate the corresponding region in FORMULA  if one ignores the effect of
coannihilations. Neglecting coannihilations, one would find an upper
bound of FORMULA  on FORMULA , corresponding to an upper bound of
roughly FORMULA  on FORMULA .
Coannihilations are important when there are several
particle species FORMULA , with different masses, and
each with its own number density FORMULA  and
equilibrium number density FORMULA .
In this case {{cite:07eeaa0b-b048-42c9-9594-4031a0f1e6db}}, the rate equation (REF ) still applies,
provided FORMULA  is
interpreted as the total number density,
FORMULA 
FORMULA  as the total equilibrium number density,
FORMULA 
and the effective annihilation cross section as
FORMULA 
In eq. (REF ), FORMULA  is now understood as the mass of the
lightest sparticle under consideration.
FIGURE 
Note that this implies that the
ratio of relic densities computed with and without coannihilations is,
roughly,

quantities computed ignoring coannihilations. The ratio FORMULA , where

The CMSSM with Universal Higgs masses
A larger view of the FORMULA  parameter plane is shown in Fig.
REF  {{cite:51715a29-42a2-4438-afd4-0b60749e83c7}}, {{cite:8c430a9c-6cb0-45e9-ac1b-82b4a4622c5c}}, {{cite:92ce8074-3232-4e12-91d5-a295d274e62d}}, {{cite:1667d986-1215-48f0-9eae-9be900e2a168}}, {{cite:341f5ba9-2ab2-4a87-81cb-a5dae57ada51}}. Included here are
the most important phenomenological constraints (shown schematically in
Figure REF ). These include the constraints on the MSSM
parameter space that are provided by direct sparticle searches at LEP,
including that on the lightest chargino FORMULA :  FORMULAFORMULA eFORMULA me FORMULA FORMULAFORMULA mH > 114.4FORMULA mhFORMULA mtFORMULA m1/2 FORMULA
FIGURE 
The constraint imposed by
measurements of FORMULA  {{cite:5ca9600a-d563-4c70-a890-d8a55f1ea3a9}} also excludes small
values of
FORMULA . These measurements agree with the Standard Model, and
therefore provide bounds on MSSM particles, such as the chargino and
charged Higgs masses, in particular. Typically, the FORMULA 
constraint is more important for FORMULA , but it is also relevant for
FORMULA , particularly when FORMULA  is large.
The latest value of the anomalous magnetic
moment of the muon reported {{cite:2d023904-c0a3-4cfe-9c03-3f61841219e3}} by the BNL E821 experiment is
also taken into account. The world average of FORMULA  now deviates by
FORMULA  from the Standard Model calculation
of {{cite:ef6e194b-4ca2-4b8e-9dbd-c1f1133a8bff}} using FORMULA  data, and by FORMULA  from the Standard Model calculation of {{cite:ef6e194b-4ca2-4b8e-9dbd-c1f1133a8bff}} based on
FORMULA  decay data. Other recent analyses of the FORMULA  data yield
similar results. On some of the subsequent plots, the formal
2-FORMULA  range FORMULA  is displayed. As one can see, the region preferred by FORMULA 
overlaps very nicely with the `bulk' region for FORMULA  and
FORMULA .
FIGURE 
As noted above, another
mechanism for extending the allowed CMSSM region to large
FORMULA  is rapid annihilation via a direct-channel pole when FORMULA  {{cite:adddee5e-da6b-46e7-8a31-9e360bf1d6dd}}, {{cite:8c430a9c-6cb0-45e9-ac1b-82b4a4622c5c}}. Since the heavy scalar and
pseudoscalar Higgs masses decrease as
FORMULA  increases, eventually FORMULA  yielding a
`funnel' extending to large
FORMULA  and
FORMULA  at large
FORMULA , as seen in Fig. REF .
The difficulty and necessary care involved in calculations at large
FORMULA  were discussed in {{cite:8c430a9c-6cb0-45e9-ac1b-82b4a4622c5c}}. For related CMSSM
calculations see {{cite:66c8d50b-fe21-41da-9943-d6745d319500}}.
Another way to see the effects of increasing FORMULA  is plot
look at the FORMULA  plane for fixed FORMULA .
This is shown in Fig. REF . As one can see, there is a charged
FORMULA  LSP in the upper right corner for both values of FORMULA , though the
area is reduced when FORMULA  is increased as is expected. One also sees the
cosmological region moving up in FORMULA  as FORMULA  is increased. In
b), one also sees the well defined coannihilation tail. Here, the
importance of FORMULA  at large FORMULA  is clearly displayed.
FIGURE 

The CMSSM with Non-Universal Higgs masses
If one relaxes the unification condition for the two soft Higgs mass,
FORMULA  and FORMULA , one could decide to make FORMULA  and FORMULA  inputs
and instead making the Higgs soft masses outputs. This is referred to as
the CMSSM with non-universal Higgs masses or NUHM {{cite:dbbd9904-ab58-4466-98fb-f5334c0bc514}}, {{cite:4f84c1c6-cc46-4fac-ac19-93ed5372be7a}}, {{cite:341f5ba9-2ab2-4a87-81cb-a5dae57ada51}}.
The attractive feature of radiative symmetry breaking in the CMSSM is
maintained by using the electroweak minimization conditions to solve for
FORMULA  and FORMULA , given values of FORMULA  and FORMULA  at the weak scale.
The electroweak symmetry breaking conditions may be written in the form:
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  and FORMULA  are loop
corrections {{cite:589a53ea-b45b-4206-8732-a1fd6dc5ce8e}}, {{cite:e084fccb-58e5-4347-be46-6aade492f6cb}}, {{cite:d5cd6954-b7a4-48c5-bf7a-d3caa179c986}} and
FORMULA .
The known radiative
corrections {{cite:589a53ea-b45b-4206-8732-a1fd6dc5ce8e}}, {{cite:70fd2dee-3086-45f0-a8b2-9d8f27d76981}}, {{cite:18fc9452-4dab-43ac-9889-a77fba88d824}}
FORMULA  and FORMULA  relating the values of the
NUHM parameters at FORMULA  to their values at FORMULA  are incorporated:
FORMULA 
Solving for FORMULA  and FORMULA , one has
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
which are used to perform the numerical calculations {{cite:341f5ba9-2ab2-4a87-81cb-a5dae57ada51}}.
It can be seen from (REF ) and (REF ) that, if FORMULA  is too small
or FORMULA  is too large, then FORMULA  and/or FORMULA  can become negative and
large. This could lead to FORMULA  and/or FORMULA , thus triggering
electroweak symmetry breaking at the GUT scale. The requirement that
electroweak symmetry breaking occurs far below the GUT scale forces one to
impose the conditions FORMULA  as
extra constraints, which we call the GUT
stability constraint For a different point of view, however,
see {{cite:fa5cece2-46c4-4b7e-be7c-84a8960e3e08}}..
The NUHM parameter space was recently analyzed {{cite:341f5ba9-2ab2-4a87-81cb-a5dae57ada51}} and a sample
of the results found is shown in Fig. REF . While much of the
cosmologically preferred area with FORMULA  is excluded, there is a
significant enhancement in the allowed parameter space for FORMULA .
FIGURE 
As usual, there are dark (red) regions where there is one or more charged
sparticle lighter than the neutralino FORMULA  so that FORMULA  is no longer the
LSP. First, there are `shark's teeth' at FORMULA  GeV,

The thick cosmological region at smaller FORMULA 
corresponds to the `bulk' region familiar from CMSSM studies. The two
(black) crosses indicate the position of the CMSSM points for these input
parameters. Extending upward in FORMULA  from this region, there is another
light (turquoise) shaded band at smaller FORMULA . Here, the neutralino
gets more Higgsino-like and the annihilation to FORMULA  becomes
important, yielding a relic density in the allowed range This is
similar to the focus-point region {{cite:55b90259-0639-45a6-9dd3-1e20a2734c01}} in the CMSSM.. For
smaller
FORMULA , the relic density becomes too small due to the FORMULA  coannihilations. For even smaller FORMULA  (FORMULA 30FORMULA hFORMULA ZFORMULA The unshaded regions between the allowed bands have a relic density that
is too high: FORMULA . However, the FORMULA  and
FORMULA  coannihilation and bulk bands are connected by
horizontal bands of acceptable relic density that are themselves
separated by unshaded regions of low relic density, threaded by solid
(blue) lines asymptoting to FORMULA  GeV. These lines correspond to cases when FORMULA , where direct-channel annihilation: FORMULA  is important,
and suppresses the relic density {{cite:8c430a9c-6cb0-45e9-ac1b-82b4a4622c5c}}, {{cite:adddee5e-da6b-46e7-8a31-9e360bf1d6dd}} creating
`funnel'-like regions.
In panel (b), a larger value of FORMULA  is chosen.
In this case, the previous region excluded by the neutral LSP constraint
at large FORMULA , migrates to larger FORMULA . The `shark's
teeth' for moderate FORMULA  grow, reaching up to FORMULA  GeV.
These arise when one combines a large value of FORMULA  with a
relatively small value of FORMULA , and one may find a FORMULA  or even a
FORMULA  LSP. The large value of FORMULA  also keeps the rate of FORMULA  under control unless FORMULA  is small. The chargino
constraint is similar to that in panel (a), whereas the FORMULA  constraint
is irrelevant due to the large value of FORMULA . Finally, the GUT
mass-squared positivity constraint now allows larger values of FORMULA 1000FORMULA It is also interesting to examine the FORMULA  - FORMULA  plane in the NUHM
{{cite:341f5ba9-2ab2-4a87-81cb-a5dae57ada51}}. In Fig. REF a, there is a bulk region at FORMULA  GeV to 350 GeV, FORMULA  GeV to 150 GeV.
As in the CMSSM, the FORMULA  is the LSP in the bigger area at
larger FORMULA , and there are light (turquoise) shaded strips close to
these forbidden regions where coannihilation suppresses the relic density
sufficiently to be cosmologically acceptable. Further away from these
regions, the relic density is generally too high. However, for larger
FORMULA  there is another suppression, discussed below, which makes the
relic density too low. At small FORMULA  and FORMULA  the left handed
sleptons, and also the sneutrinos, become lighter than the neutralino. The
darker (dark blue) shaded area is where a sneutrino is the LSP.
The near-vertical dark (black) dashed and light (red) dot-dashed lines in
Fig. REF  are the LEP exclusion contours FORMULA  GeV and FORMULA  GeV respectively. As in the CMSSM case, they
exclude low values of
FORMULA , and hence rule out rapid relic annihilation via direct-channel
FORMULA  and FORMULA  poles. The solid lines curved around small values of
FORMULA  and FORMULA  bound the light (pink) shaded region favoured by
FORMULA  and recent analyses of the FORMULA  data.
FIGURE 
A striking feature in Fig. REF (a) when FORMULA  GeV
is a strip with low FORMULA , which has bands with acceptable relic
density on either side. The low-FORMULA  strip is due to rapid
annihilation via the direct-channel FORMULA  poles which occur when FORMULA  GeV, indicated by the near-vertical solid (blue) line.
The analogous rapid-annihilation strips occur in
the CMSSM but at larger FORMULA  as seen in
Fig. REF . There, they are diagonal in the FORMULA 
plane, reflecting a CMSSM link between FORMULA  and FORMULA  that is absent in
this implementation of the NUHM. The right-hand band in
Fig. REF (a) with acceptable FORMULA  is broadened because the
neutralino acquires significant Higgsino content, and the relic density
is suppressed by the increased FORMULA  production. As
FORMULA  increases, the neutralino becomes almost degenerate with the
second lightest neutralino and the lighter chargino, and the FORMULA  coannihilation processes
eventually push FORMULA  when FORMULA 700FORMULA The two dark (black) dash-dotted lines in Fig. REF (a)
indicate where scalar squared masses become negative at the input GUT
scale for one of the Higgs multiplets. One of these GUT
stability lines is
near-vertical at FORMULA  GeV, and the other is a curved line at
FORMULA  GeV, FORMULA  GeV.
Panel (b) of Fig. REF  is for FORMULA  GeV and FORMULA  GeV. We notice immediately that the heavy Higgs pole and the
right-hand boundary of the GUT stability region move out to larger
FORMULA  GeV, respectively, as one would expect for
larger FORMULA . At this value of FORMULA , the right side of the
rapid annihilation (`funnel') strip has disappeared, due to enhanced
chargino-neutralino coannihilation effects.
These two examples serve to demonstrate that the FORMULA  plane
may look rather different in the CMSSM from its appearance in the CMSSM
for the same value of FORMULA . In particular, the locations of
rapid-annihilation funnels and FORMULA 
coannihilation regions are quite model-dependent, and the GUT stability
requirement may exclude large parts of the FORMULA  plane.
Detection
Because the LSP as dark matter is present locally, there are many
avenues for pursuing dark matter detection. Direct detection techniques
rely on an ample neutralino-nucleon scattering cross-section.
The effective four-fermion lagrangian can be written as
FORMULA 
However, the terms involving FORMULA , and
FORMULA  lead to velocity dependent elastic cross sections.
The remaining terms are: the spin dependent coefficient,
FORMULA  and the scalar coefficient FORMULA .
Contributions to FORMULA  are predominantly through light squark exchange. This is the dominant channel for binos.
Scattering also occurs through Z exchange but this channel
requires a strong Higgsino component.
Contributions to FORMULA  are also dominated by
light squark exchange but Higgs exchange
is non-negligible in most cases.
Fig. REF  displays contours of the
spin-independent cross section for the elastic scattering of the LSP
FORMULA  on protons in the FORMULA  planes for (a) FORMULA , (b) FORMULA  {{cite:24485371-6c3b-4efc-8030-5d09d3661586}}. The double
dot-dashed (orange) lines are contours of the spin-independent cross
section, and the contours
FORMULA  pb in panel (a) and FORMULA  pb in panel (b) are
indicated.
The LEP lower limits on FORMULA  and FORMULA , as well as the
experimental measurement of FORMULA  for FORMULA , tend to bound
the cross sections from above, as discussed in more
detail below. Generally speaking, the spin-independent cross section is
relatively large in the `bulk' region, but falls off in the coannihilation
`tail'. Also, we note also that there is a strong
cancellation in the spin-independent cross section when
FORMULA  {{cite:1b574ac0-0766-49ce-ba8b-f7abad3ad401}}, {{cite:b0bf5490-1ecb-4b9e-b75c-332a455ecdf2}}, as seen along strips in panel (a) of
Fig. REF  where
FORMULA  GeV. In the cancellation region,
the cross section drops lower than FORMULA  pb. All these possibilities
for suppressed spin-independent cross sections are disfavoured by the
data on
FORMULA , which favour values of FORMULA  and
FORMULA  that are not very large, as well as FORMULA , as seen in panel
(b) of Fig. REF . Thus FORMULA  tends to provide a
lower bound on the spin-independent cross section.
FIGURE 
Fig. REF (a) illustrates the effect on the cross sections
of each of the principal phenomenological constraints, for the particular
case FORMULA  FORMULA . The solid
(blue) lines mark the bounds on the cross sections allowed by the
relic-density constraint FORMULA 
alone.
For any given value of
FORMULA , only a restricted range of FORMULA  is allowed. Therefore, only a
limited range of FORMULA , and hence only a limited range for the cross
section, is allowed for any given value of
FORMULA . The thicknesses of the allowed regions are due in part to the
assumed
uncertainties in the nuclear inputs. These have been discussed at
length in {{cite:b0bf5490-1ecb-4b9e-b75c-332a455ecdf2}}, {{cite:1b574ac0-0766-49ce-ba8b-f7abad3ad401}}.
On
the other hand, a broad range of FORMULA  is allowed, when one takes into
account the coannihilation `tail' region at each FORMULA  and the rapid-annihilation `funnel' regions for FORMULA . The dashed (black) line displays the range allowed by
the FORMULA  constraint alone. In
this case, a broader range of FORMULA  and hence the spin-independent cross
section is possible for any given value of FORMULA . The impact of the
constraint due to FORMULA  is shown by the dot-dashed (green) line.
Comparing with the previous constraints, we see that a region at low
FORMULA  is excluded by FORMULA , strengthening significantly the previous
upper limit on the spin-independent cross section. Finally, the
dotted (red) lines in Fig. REF  show the impact of the
FORMULA  constraint. This imposes an upper bound on
FORMULA  and hence FORMULA , and correspondingly a lower limit on
the spin-independent cross section.

on the cross sections for FORMULA , and FORMULA  for
larger FORMULA , with FORMULA  always providing a more stringent
lower limit than the relic-density constraint.
The relic density constraint shown is evaluated at the endpoint of the
coannihilation region. At large FORMULA , the
Higgs funnels or the focus-point regions have not been considered, as
their locations are very sensitive to input parameters and calculational
details {{cite:6c9b4147-0bb2-4ba2-81e5-f785bad33826}}.
The results from a CMSSM and MSSM analysis {{cite:1b574ac0-0766-49ce-ba8b-f7abad3ad401}}, {{cite:b0bf5490-1ecb-4b9e-b75c-332a455ecdf2}} for FORMULA  and 10 are compared with the most recent CDMS {{cite:a5e78566-9781-41e7-ad72-d092eca622d5}} and
Edelweiss {{cite:0dea8990-56fd-4cf7-bf65-5563a4386a8a}} bounds in Fig. REF . These results have nearly
entirely excluded the region purported by the DAMA {{cite:4cd5aea6-cb89-439d-99f5-3303c10af8ba}} experiment.
The CMSSM prediction
{{cite:1b574ac0-0766-49ce-ba8b-f7abad3ad401}} is shown by the dark shaded region, while the NUHM case {{cite:b0bf5490-1ecb-4b9e-b75c-332a455ecdf2}} is
shown by the larger lighter shaded region.

FIGURE 
I conclude by showing the
prospects for direct detection for the benchmark points discussed
above{{cite:8036ff87-06a5-4985-a777-9dfe6227c21d}}. Fig. REF  shows rates for the elastic
spin-independent scattering of supersymmetric relics,
including the projected sensitivities for CDMS
II {{cite:943f3693-7d4e-4674-854e-bbc5097cee4e}} and CRESST {{cite:52127ffe-85b9-474c-ade2-6d01fec89a96}} (solid) and
GENIUS {{cite:2a38e8af-3edd-45ba-9ddf-be5d4d40ff7a}} (dashed).
Also shown are the cross sections
calculated in the proposed benchmark scenarios discussed in the previous
section, which are considerably below the DAMA {{cite:4cd5aea6-cb89-439d-99f5-3303c10af8ba}} range
(FORMULA  pb).
Indirect searches for supersymmetric dark matter via the products of
annihilations in the galactic halo or inside the Sun also have prospects
in some of the benchmark scenarios {{cite:8036ff87-06a5-4985-a777-9dfe6227c21d}}.
