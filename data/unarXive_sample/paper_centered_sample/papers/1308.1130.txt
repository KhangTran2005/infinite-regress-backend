Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, Nevanlinna-Pick kernels

We show that the Hardy space on the unit disk is the only non-trivial irreducible reproducing kernel Hilbert
space which satisfies the complete Nevanlinna-Pick property and hyponormality of all multiplication operators.

Introduction
Let FORMULA  be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space on a set FORMULA  with kernel FORMULA .
In this short note, we study the relationship between two possible properties of FORMULA :
the complete Nevanlinna-Pick property and hyponormality of multiplication operators.
Recall that FORMULA  is said to be a Nevanlinna-Pick space if, given
FORMULA  and FORMULA , positivity of the matrix
FORMULA 
is not only a necessary, but also a sufficient condition for the existence of a multiplier
FORMULA  on FORMULA  of norm at most 1 with
FORMULA 
If the analogous result
for matrix-valued interpolation holds, then FORMULA  is called a complete Nevanlinna-Pick space (compare Chapter 5 in {{cite:00978e01-7bfa-42e4-9749-6ea6578e68d5}}).
Spaces with this property have attracted a lot of attention, and it is known that they admit
appropriate versions of some classical theorems for the Hardy space FORMULA  on the disk,
such as the commutant lifting theorem {{cite:232074e2-1e54-465f-a738-c6c8b06bad61}} (see also {{cite:62b75e5a-08e0-4512-94aa-8d7ed5e32f64}}), the Toeplitz-corona theorem {{cite:00978e01-7bfa-42e4-9749-6ea6578e68d5}} and Beurling's theorem {{cite:00978e01-7bfa-42e4-9749-6ea6578e68d5}}.
The second property we consider is hyponormality of multiplication operators, that is, the property that for every
multiplier FORMULA  on FORMULA , the corresponding multiplication operator FORMULA 
is hyponormal. While multiplication operators are not normal in typical examples,
they are subnormal and hence hyponormal for
a number of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, including Hardy and Bergman spaces on domains
in FORMULA .
Two results concerning weighted Hardy spaces serve as a motivation for the study of the relationship between the two properties.
Suppose for a moment that FORMULA  is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space on the open unit disk FORMULA  with kernel FORMULA  of the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is a sequence of positive numbers with FORMULA .
Note that the classical Hardy space FORMULA  corresponds
to the choice FORMULA  for all FORMULA , in which case we recover the Szegő kernel FORMULA .
We assume that multiplication by the coordinate
function FORMULA  induces a bounded multiplication operator FORMULA  on FORMULA .
Equivalently, the sequence FORMULA  is bounded.
Then the operator FORMULA  is hyponormal if and only if
FORMULA 
(see Section 7 in {{cite:e8ec4b39-a1e6-4e69-893a-4942a0a67344}}, and note that the sequence FORMULA  there is related to FORMULA  via
FORMULA ).
On the other hand, a sufficient condition for FORMULA  being a complete Nevanlinna-Pick space is that the reverse inequalities
FORMULA 
hold (see Lemma 7.38 and Theorem 7.33 in {{cite:00978e01-7bfa-42e4-9749-6ea6578e68d5}}).
Since this condition is not necessary, the two results do not immediately tell us anything new about
weighted Hardy spaces satisfying both the Nevanlinna-Pick property and hyponormality
of multiplication operators.
Nevertheless, they seem to indicate that the presence of both properties is special.
The aim of this note is to show that the Hardy space is essentially the only complete Nevanlinna-Pick space whose
multiplication operators are hyponormal. Recall that a reproducing kernel Hilbert space FORMULA  with kernel FORMULA  on a set FORMULA  is called
irreducible if FORMULA  is never zero
for FORMULA  and if FORMULA  and FORMULA  are linearly independent for different FORMULA .
We call a set FORMULA  a set of uniqueness for FORMULA  if the only element
of FORMULA  which vanishes on FORMULA  is the zero function.
The main result now reads as follows.
Theorem 1.1 
Let FORMULA  be an irreducible complete Nevanlinna-Pick space on a set FORMULA  with kernel FORMULA 
such that all
multiplication operators on FORMULA  are hyponormal. Then one of the following possibilities holds:

FORMULA  is a singleton and FORMULA .

There is a set of uniqueness FORMULA  for FORMULA ,
a bijection FORMULA  and a nowhere vanishing function FORMULA 
such that
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes the Szegő kernel.
Hence,
FORMULA 
is a unitary operator. If FORMULA  is endowed with a topology such that FORMULA  is separately continuous on FORMULA ,
then FORMULA  is continuous. If FORMULA  and FORMULA  is holomorphic in the first variable,
then FORMULA  is holomorphic.


Since the Hardy space FORMULA  is a complete Nevanlinna-Pick space whose multiplication operators
are hyponormal, it is easy to see
that the same is true for every space as in part (2).
Hence, this result characterizes Hilbert function spaces with these two properties.
Remark 1.2 (a)
It is well known that sets of uniqueness for FORMULA  are characterized by the Blaschke condition (see, for example,
{{cite:184365b5-a780-42da-9de9-dd2ed63b0710}}):
A set FORMULA  is a set of uniqueness for FORMULA  if and only if
FORMULA 
(b)
The condition that FORMULA  is never zero is not very restrictive. Indeed, if we drop this condition,
then FORMULA  can be partitioned into sets FORMULA  such that the restriction of FORMULA  to each FORMULA  (compare the next section)
is an irreducible complete Nevanlinna-Pick space (see {{cite:00978e01-7bfa-42e4-9749-6ea6578e68d5}}).
This yields a decomposition of FORMULA  into an orthogonal direct
sum of irreducible complete Nevanlinna-Pick spaces FORMULA .
It is not hard to see that this decomposition is reducing for multiplication operators.
Hence, all multiplication operators on FORMULA  are hyponormal if and only if
this is true for each summand.
We omit the details.

Before we come to the proof of the main result, let us consider an application to Hilbert function spaces
in higher dimensions. In particular, this applies to holomorphic Hilbert function spaces on the open unit ball
in FORMULA  for FORMULA .
Standard examples of such spaces either have the property that all multiplication
operators are hyponormal (such as Hardy and Bergman space)
or have the Nevanlinna-Pick property (such as the Drury-Arveson space, see the next section), but not both.
This is not a coincidence.
Corollary 1.3 Let FORMULA  be a natural number, and let FORMULA  be an open set. Then there is no irreducible
complete Nevanlinna-Pick space on FORMULA  which consists of continuous functions and whose
multiplication operators are all hyponormal.

Assume toward a contradiction that FORMULA  is such a Hilbert functions space, and let FORMULA  be its kernel. Since
the functions in FORMULA  are continuous, it follows that FORMULA  is separately continuous. Hence, Theorem REF 
implies that there is a continuous injection FORMULA . But this is impossible if FORMULA 
due to Brouwer's domain invariance theorem {{cite:c11c4d77-a6c7-41b6-a0b9-056d2e60173e}}.

Embedding into Drury-Arveson space
As a first step in the proof of the main result, we will embed the complete Nevanlinna-Pick
space FORMULA  into the Drury-Arveson space.
Given a cardinal FORMULA , we write FORMULA  for the open unit ball in FORMULA . The Drury-Arveson
space FORMULA  is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space on FORMULA  with kernel
FORMULA 
If FORMULA , this is the Hardy space FORMULA . For FORMULA ,
Arveson {{cite:baeaf726-1436-4bf4-89f0-56d0ccad9821}} exhibited multipliers on FORMULA  which are not hyponormal by
showing that their spectral radius is strictly less then their multiplier norm. Indeed, if FORMULA  and FORMULA  denote
the coordinate functions on FORMULA , then FORMULA  is not
hyponormal on FORMULA , as
FORMULA 
(see {{cite:baeaf726-1436-4bf4-89f0-56d0ccad9821}}). This observation readily generalizes to FORMULA .
Given a subset FORMULA , we write
FORMULA  for the reproducing kernel Hilbert space on FORMULA  with kernel
FORMULA . A well-known result about Hilbert function spaces asserts that
FORMULA 
and that the restriction map FORMULA  is a coisometry. Hence, if
FORMULA 
denotes the kernel of the restriction map, then
FORMULA 
is a unitary. The following theorem due to
Agler and McCarthy provides the desired embedding of FORMULA  into the Drury-Arveson space.
Theorem 2.1 
Let FORMULA  be an irreducible complete Nevanlinna-Pick space on a set FORMULA  with kernel FORMULA .
Assume that FORMULA  is normalized at FORMULA  in
the sense that FORMULA  for all FORMULA . Then
there is a cardinal FORMULA  and an injection FORMULA  with FORMULA  such that
FORMULA 
Hence,
FORMULA 
is a unitary operator, where FORMULA .

See {{cite:7dd9008a-524f-42ad-80fd-c6b98c1dfc1f}}, or Theorem 8.2 and Theorem 7.31 in {{cite:00978e01-7bfa-42e4-9749-6ea6578e68d5}}. To deduce the second part from
the first one, note that the identity for the kernels implies that
FORMULA 
is unitary. Therefore, the composition of this map with the unitary operator in (REF )
is unitary as well.
In the above setting, let FORMULA . This space is co-invariant under multiplication operators.
Clearly, every FORMULA  restricts to a multiplier on FORMULA , and hence
gives rise to the multiplier FORMULA  on FORMULA . If FORMULA  denotes the unitary operator
in Theorem REF , then
FORMULA 
Thus, if we assume that all multiplication operators on FORMULA  are hyponormal, then all operators appearing
on the right-hand side of the last identity are hyponormal as well. We will use this fact to show that FORMULA 
can be identified with FORMULA .

Proof of the main result
The discussion at the end of the last section suggests studying compressions of multiplication
operators to co-invariant subspaces such that the compressed operator is hyponormal.
We need the following simple observation.
Lemma 3.1 
Let FORMULA  be a Hilbert space,
let FORMULA  and let FORMULA  be a co-invariant subspace for FORMULA . Suppose
that the compression of FORMULA  to FORMULA  is hyponormal. If FORMULA  with FORMULA ,
then FORMULA .

Since FORMULA  is co-invariant under FORMULA , and since FORMULA  is hyponormal, we have
FORMULA 
Consequently, FORMULA , and hence FORMULA .
We will apply this observation to multiplication operators on FORMULA . Since the coordinate functions FORMULA 
are multipliers on FORMULA , it follows from unitary invariance of the Drury-Arveson space that
all functions of the form FORMULA  for FORMULA  are multipliers on FORMULA .
Lemma 3.2 
Suppose that FORMULA  is a closed subspace which is co-invariant under multiplication operators
and that for every FORMULA , the compression
FORMULA  is hyponormal. Then the following assertions hold.

If FORMULA  and
FORMULA  for some FORMULA , then FORMULA .

If FORMULA , then
FORMULA  for all FORMULA .


(a) Let
FORMULA 
where the series converges in FORMULA . From
FORMULA 
we deduce that
FORMULA 
On the other hand, using that FORMULA  is orthogonal to FORMULA  if FORMULA , we see that
FORMULA 
Lemma REF  implies that FORMULA  contains the element
FORMULA , and thus also
FORMULA 
(b)
The proof is by induction on FORMULA . The base case FORMULA  holds by assumption. Suppose that FORMULA  and the assertion
is true for FORMULA . It is well known that if FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
from which we deduce that
FORMULA 
On the other hand,
FORMULA 
so that
FORMULA 
by Lemma REF .
Given FORMULA , it can happen that there is a larger set FORMULA  such that every function in FORMULA 
extends uniquely to a function in FORMULA . To account for that, we define
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  is the largest set which contains FORMULA  and satisfies this extension property. Moreover,
it is easy to see that
FORMULA 
Lemma 3.3 
Let FORMULA  be a set with FORMULA , and set
FORMULA . If the compression
FORMULA  is hyponormal for
every FORMULA , then FORMULA  is a complex ball, that is,
FORMULA 
for some closed subspace FORMULA  of FORMULA .

Let FORMULA  be the closed linear span of FORMULA .
Observe that for all FORMULA , we have FORMULA . Since FORMULA ,
part (a) of Lemma REF  implies that
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . It follows that
FORMULA 
as FORMULA  is a conjugate linear isometry.
Using part (b) of Lemma REF , we deduce that
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . This argument shows that FORMULA , and the reverse
inclusion is trivial.
We can now prove the main result.
If FORMULA  is a singleton, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, fix FORMULA . Since FORMULA  is an irreducible
kernel, it is nowhere zero, so we can consider the normalized kernel defined by
FORMULA 
where
FORMULA 
Then FORMULA  for all FORMULA . Moreover, if FORMULA  denotes the reproducing kernel
Hilbert space with kernel FORMULA , then
FORMULA 
is a unitary operator.
It is easy to see that FORMULA  also
satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem REF , so we will work with FORMULA  instead of FORMULA .
We will show that FORMULA  can be identified with FORMULA  for a suitable
cardinal FORMULA . It will then follow that FORMULA  is necessarily 1.
By Theorem REF , there is an injection FORMULA  for some cardinal FORMULA 
such that FORMULA  and such that
FORMULA 
holds for all FORMULA .
Define FORMULA  and FORMULA , and
note that FORMULA .
The discussion at the end of Section  now shows that FORMULA 
satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma REF , hence
FORMULA 
for some closed subspace FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the dimension of the Hilbert space FORMULA . As FORMULA  is not a singleton, FORMULA .
Clearly, FORMULA , so that the restriction map from
FORMULA  into FORMULA  is unitary.
If FORMULA  is an isometry from FORMULA  onto FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Therefore,
FORMULA 
is a unitary operator as well. Combining this map with the unitary from Theorem REF ,
we obtain a unitary
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
By assumption, all multiplication operators on FORMULA  are hyponormal,
hence the same is true for FORMULA . This is only possible if
FORMULA  (see the discussion at the beginning of Section ), so that the last operator is in fact
a unitary from FORMULA  onto FORMULA . Injectivity of this operator implies that FORMULA  is a set
of uniqueness for FORMULA . Combining the identities for the various kernels, we see that
FORMULA 
as asserted.
To prove the additional assertion, let FORMULA . Then FORMULA , so rearranging
equation (REF ), we obtain for FORMULA  the formula
FORMULA 
Taking the definition of FORMULA  into account, it follows that FORMULA  is continuous (respectively holomorphic)
whenever FORMULA  is.
Remark 3.4 
For the most part of the proof of Theorem REF , we only used hyponormality of operators
of the form FORMULA  for FORMULA  (notation as above).
If FORMULA  is an irreducible complete Nevanlinna-Pick space with kernel FORMULA , normalized at some point FORMULA , then
these operators correspond to multiplication operators on FORMULA  with
multipliers of the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  is the injection from Theorem REF .
These multipliers play the role of coordinate functions for Nevanlinna-Pick spaces (see the discussion
preceding Beurling's theorem for Nevanlinna-Pick spaces {{cite:00978e01-7bfa-42e4-9749-6ea6578e68d5}}).
The only argument which requires hyponormality of more general multiplication operators is the proof that FORMULA .
Thus, if we only require hyponormality of multiplication operators corresponding to functions as in
(REF ) in Theorem REF ,
then FORMULA  will be equivalent to FORMULA  (in the sense
of part (2) of Theorem REF ) for some cardinal FORMULA .
