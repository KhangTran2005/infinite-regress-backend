Nonlinear FORMULA -Jordan-type derivation, von Neumann algebra

Let FORMULA  be a complex Hilbert space, FORMULA  be the algebra of all
bounded linear operators on FORMULA  and FORMULA 
be a von Neumann algebra without central summands of type FORMULA . For arbitrary elements
FORMULA , one can define their FORMULA -Jordan product in the sense of
FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be the polynomial
defined by FORMULA  indeterminates FORMULA 
and their FORMULA -Jordan products. In this article, it is shown that a mapping
FORMULA  satisfies the condition
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  is an additive FORMULA -derivation.

Introduction
Let FORMULA  be an associative FORMULA -algebra over the complex field FORMULA .
For any FORMULA , one can denote a “new product" of FORMULA  and FORMULA  by
FORMULA , and this new product FORMULA  is usually said to be FORMULA -Jordan product.
Such kind of product based on Jordan bracket naturally
appears in relation with the so-called Jordan FORMULA -derivations and plays an important
role in the problem of representability of quadratic functionals by sesqui-linear
functionals on left-modules over FORMULA -algebras (see {{cite:16244409-30d3-42bc-b40c-706dd3f73100}}, {{cite:f51efa6d-5f8e-4ab0-ade2-624d43b33504}}, {{cite:a2bbb9ab-53d3-4f4e-ad56-f458f96926a4}}).
The product is workable for us to characterize ideals, see {{cite:918beb0a-3600-4877-9754-8746232ede6b}}, {{cite:c2762318-c603-4830-b297-1b259dc41ae0}}, {{cite:cd496294-b8e0-4e09-bd51-f127796ee4bc}}.
Especial attention has been paid to understanding mappings which preserve the product
FORMULA  between FORMULA -algebras, see {{cite:061dfbdc-ed84-44f0-9fa2-b3c45177508b}}, {{cite:fddf98de-096c-4d6b-bac3-d3feef2bdd13}}, {{cite:2ee956f0-d704-4db6-ac03-151f2bcf217f}}, {{cite:f2a61a77-0e75-43d5-949e-9640e2decc98}}, {{cite:e9f4993e-97fb-498b-9d20-abdbeb2bacb2}}.
The question of to what extent the multiplicative structure of an algebra determines its
additive structure has been considered by many researchers over the past decades.
In particular, they have investigated under which conditions bijective mappings
between algebras preserving the multiplicative structure necessarily preserve the
additive structure as well. The most fundamental result in this direction is due
to W. S. Martindale III {{cite:249c1580-e3a4-4c08-8e39-79ee226bf81b}} who proved that every bijective
multiplicative mapping from a prime ring containing a nontrivial idempotent
onto an arbitrary ring is necessarily additive. Later, a number of authors
considered the Jordan-type product or Lie-type product and proved that,
on certain associative algebras or rings, bijective mappings which preserve
any of those products are automatically additive, see
{{cite:2edc9f3b-af64-4657-abdc-4daac6aff886}}, {{cite:918beb0a-3600-4877-9754-8746232ede6b}}, {{cite:f298bcc5-e941-43bc-8293-ec83f1c593bf}}, {{cite:061dfbdc-ed84-44f0-9fa2-b3c45177508b}}, {{cite:fddf98de-096c-4d6b-bac3-d3feef2bdd13}}, {{cite:2ee956f0-d704-4db6-ac03-151f2bcf217f}}, {{cite:f2a61a77-0e75-43d5-949e-9640e2decc98}}, {{cite:24cb41b9-f3b2-4c9e-9afd-705541a84cb7}}, {{cite:5d70cd93-b9da-4491-a656-2f4d53f68c62}}, {{cite:e9f4993e-97fb-498b-9d20-abdbeb2bacb2}}.
An additive mapping FORMULA  is called an
additive derivation if FORMULA  for all FORMULA .
Furthermore, FORMULA  is said to be an additive FORMULA -derivation provided that FORMULA 
is an additive derivation and satisfies FORMULA  for all FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be a mapping
(without the additivity assumption). We say that FORMULA  is a
nonlinear FORMULA -Jordan derivation if
FORMULA 
holds true for all FORMULA . Similarly, a mapping FORMULA  is called a nonlinear FORMULA -Jordan triple derivation if it satisfies the condition
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA , where FORMULA  .
We should be aware that FORMULA  is not necessarily associative.
Given the consideration of FORMULA -Jordan derivations and FORMULA -Jordan triple derivations, we can
further develop them in one natural way. Suppose that FORMULA  is a fixed positive
integer. Let us see a sequence of polynomials with  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Accordingly, a nonlinear FORMULA -Jordan FORMULA -derivation is a mapping FORMULA  satisfying the condition
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . This notion makes the best use of the definition of Lie-type derivations
and that of FORMULA -Lie-type derivations, see {{cite:349e5cca-3d27-4bdf-970c-dfa5619607e8}}, {{cite:4e414da4-93e3-43b3-babf-61bb4ab1b196}}, {{cite:6d748fac-662a-4a51-b90a-5ee5acfee64a}}.
By the definition, it is clear that every FORMULA -Jordan derivation is a
FORMULA -Jordan 2-derivation and each FORMULA -Jordan triple derivation is a FORMULA -Jordan 3-derivation.
One can easily check that each nonlinear FORMULA -Jordan derivation on FORMULA  is
a nonlinear FORMULA -Jordan triple derivation. But, we don't know whether the converse statement is true.
FORMULA -Jordan 2-derivations, FORMULA -Jordan 3-derivations and FORMULA -Jordan FORMULA -derivations
are collectively referred to as FORMULA -Jordan-type derivations.
FORMULA -Jordan-type derivations on operator algebras have been studied by
several authors. Let FORMULA  be a complex Hilbert space and FORMULA  be the algebra of all
bounded linear operators on FORMULA . Li et al in {{cite:4a24b1ee-292e-45f1-a962-b6de848eee85}} showed that if FORMULA  is a von Neumann
algebra without central summands of type FORMULA , then FORMULA  is a
nonlinear FORMULA -Jordan derivation if and only if FORMULA  is an additive FORMULA -derivation.
More recently, this result is extended to the case of nonlinear FORMULA -Jordan triple derivations by Zhao and Li {{cite:4e54635b-6071-41d2-815a-b9a43bbd1afd}}.
Taghavi et al {{cite:0776f7a6-e3df-470e-a7a5-022b11e6c225}} and Zhang {{cite:fab2821c-035c-4af4-8370-57154a4fa43d}} independently investigate
FORMULA -Jordan derivations on factor von Neumann algebras, respectively. It turns out that
each nonlinear FORMULA -Jordan derivation on a factor von Neumann algebra is an additive FORMULA -derivation.
Inspired by the afore-mentioned works, we will concentrate on giving a description of nonlinear
FORMULA -Jordan-type derivations on von Neumann algebras. The organization of this paper is as follows.
We recall and collect some indispensable facts with respect to von Neumann algebras in the
second section . The third Section  is devoted to our main result
Theorem REF  and its proof. The main theorem states that every nonlinear
FORMULA -Jordan-type derivation on a von Neumann algebra without central summands of type FORMULA 
is an additive FORMULA -derivation. Similar statements are also given for factor von Neumann algebras
and standard operator algebras without proofs. Some potential topics for the future research are presented in the last Section .

Preliminaries
Throughout this paper, FORMULA  denotes a complex Hilbert space and FORMULA 
is the algebra of all bounded linear operators on FORMULA . A von Neumann algebra
FORMULA  is weakly closed, self-adjoint algebra of operators on FORMULA  containing
the identity operator FORMULA . The set FORMULA 
is called the centre of FORMULA .
A projection FORMULA  is called a central abelian projection if FORMULA 
and FORMULA  is abelian. Recall that the central carrier of FORMULA , denoted by FORMULA , is
the smallest central projection FORMULA  satisfying the condition FORMULA . It is straightforward to
check that the central carrier of FORMULA  is the projection onto the closed subspace spanned by
FORMULA . If FORMULA  is self-adjoint, then the core
of FORMULA , denoted by FORMULA , is FORMULA . If FORMULA 
is a projection, it is clear that FORMULA  is the largest central projection FORMULA  with FORMULA .
A projection FORMULA  is said to be core-free if FORMULA . It is not difficult to see
that FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA .
To round off the proof of our main theorem, we need to give some necessary lemmas.
Lemma 2.1 {{cite:3de6d95a-3a6b-4b7b-b685-072c5646551d}}
Let FORMULA  be a von Neumann without central summands of type FORMULA .
Then each nonzero central projection in FORMULA  is the central carrier of
a core-free projection in FORMULA .

Lemma 2.2 {{cite:4a24b1ee-292e-45f1-a962-b6de848eee85}}
Let FORMULA  be a von Neumann algebra on a Hilbert space FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  and FORMULA  is a projection with
FORMULA . If FORMULA  for all FORMULA , then FORMULA .

Lemma 2.3 
Let FORMULA  be a von Neumann algebra without central summands of type FORMULA .
For any FORMULA  and for any positive integer FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 

By a recursive calculation, we know that
FORMULA 
Similarly, we also have
FORMULA 
Let FORMULA  be a von Neumann algebra without central summands of type FORMULA .
By Lemma REF , we know that there exists a nonzero central projection
FORMULA  such that FORMULA  and FORMULA . For the convenience of discussion,
let us set FORMULA , FORMULA . We write FORMULA .
Thus one gets FORMULA . We denote the imaginary
unit by FORMULA .
Lemma 2.4 
Let FORMULA  be a von Neumann algebra without central summands of type FORMULA .
For any FORMULA  with FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have

FORMULA  implies that FORMULA .

FORMULA  implies that FORMULA .

FORMULA  implies that FORMULA .


Let us first prove the assertion (a).
We have
FORMULA 
which leads to FORMULA .
The other two assertions can be achieved by an analogous manner.

Main Theorem and Its Proof
We are in a position to give the main theorem of this article which can be stated
as follows.
Theorem 3.1 
Let FORMULA  be a von Neumann algebra without central summands of
type FORMULA . Then a mapping FORMULA  satisfies the rule
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  is an additive FORMULA -derivation.

The proof of this theorem can be realized via a series of claims.

Claim 1. FORMULA .
FORMULA 
Claim 2. For any FORMULA , we have FORMULA .

Note that the fact FORMULA . By Lemma REF  it follows that
FORMULA 
This gives
FORMULA 
That is,
FORMULA 
Using the relation (3.1), we get
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . Thus we obtain
FORMULA 
That is,
FORMULA 
Claim 3. For any FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
We only need to prove the case of FORMULA , and the proofs of the other cases are rather similar
and are omitted here. Let us write
FORMULA 
It is sufficient for us to show that FORMULA . Since
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
we by Claim 2 have
FORMULA 
We therefore get
FORMULA 
In light of Lemma REF , we obtain
FORMULA 
It follows from Lemma REF  that
FORMULA 
Notice that
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
By Claim 2, we observe that
FORMULA 
Thus we arrive at
FORMULA 
Taking into account Lemma REF , we get
FORMULA 
Applying Lemma REF  yields that
FORMULA 
We therefore have FORMULA . That is,
FORMULA 
The other cases can be verified by an analogous manner.

Claim 4. For any FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
We only need to show that
FORMULA 
Since
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
we obtain
FORMULA 
Hence, we have
FORMULA 
Applying Lemma REF  gives
FORMULA 
By Lemma REF , we know that
FORMULA 
Note that the facts
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Using similar computations as the above, we get
FORMULA 
In view of Lemma REF  and the fact FORMULA , one can see that
FORMULA 
On the other hand, we should remark that
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Using similar arguments as the above, one can get FORMULA .

Claim 5. For all FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
It is sufficient to prove that
FORMULA 
Since
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
we konw that
FORMULA 
Thus we obtain
FORMULA 
By invoking of Lemma REF , we arrive at
FORMULA 
It follows from Lemma REF  that
FORMULA 
We should remark that
FORMULA 
and that
FORMULA 
Using similar discussions as the above, one can get
FORMULA 
Hence we conclude that FORMULA . That is,
FORMULA 
Claim 6. For any FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have

FORMULA ,

FORMULA .

Let us first prove the result (a). For convenience, let us set
FORMULA 
We shall prove that FORMULA . In view of the facts
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
we by Claim 4 get
FORMULA 
By Lemma REF  we know that
FORMULA 
It follows from Lemma REF  that
FORMULA 
In order to show FORMULA , we should note that
FORMULA 
and that
FORMULA 
Using Claim 3, we see that
FORMULA 
This implies that
FORMULA 
According to Lemma REF , we know that FORMULA . Thus we arrive at
FORMULA 
Considering the relations
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
together with the previous calculations, we assert that
FORMULA 
Claim 7. For any FORMULA  and FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
We only need to prove that
FORMULA 
Note the facts that
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
Applying Claim 6 (a) yields that
FORMULA 
Thus we obtain
FORMULA 
So FORMULA  by Lemma REF .

Similarly, using the relations
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
one can get FORMULA . The proof of this claim is completed.

Claim 8. For any FORMULA , we have
FORMULA 
Case 1: FORMULA .
Note that
FORMULA 
In light of Claim 6, we know that
FORMULA 
On the other hand, we by Claim 3 and Claim 4 have
FORMULA 
Compare (3.2) with (3.3) gives
FORMULA 
Case 2: FORMULA .

Let us set FORMULA . Let us take FORMULA , but FORMULA . Since
FORMULA 
and
FORMULA 
we know that
FORMULA 
Then we have
FORMULA 
By invoking of Lemma REF , we arrive at FORMULA .

The last step is to show that FORMULA . Since
FORMULA 
and by Case 1 of this claim and Claim 4, we have
FORMULA 
Thus we obtain
FORMULA 
It follows that FORMULA . That is, FORMULA  for
all FORMULA . Note that FORMULA . In light of Lemma REF ,
we conclude that FORMULA .

As an immediate consequence of the previous Claims, we have

Claim 9. FORMULA  is an additive mapping.

Let us next show that FORMULA  is a FORMULA -derivation.

Claim 10. For any FORMULA , we have FORMULA .

In view of Lemma REF , we konw that
FORMULA 
It follows that
FORMULA 
Thus we get FORMULA .

We next prove that FORMULA  is actually a derivation.

Claim 11. For any FORMULA , we have  FORMULA
Since
FORMULA 
we obtain
FORMULA 
It follows that
FORMULA 
Replacing FORMULA  (resp. FORMULA ) by FORMULA  (resp. FORMULA ) in (3.4) and using Claim 9, we arrive at
FORMULA 
Combining (3.4) with (3.5) gives
FORMULA 
By an analogous manner, we can prove
Theorem 3.2 
Let FORMULA  be the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space
FORMULA  and FORMULA  be a factor von Neumann algebra.
Then a mapping FORMULA  satisfies the rule
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  is an additive FORMULA -derivation.

FORMULA  denotes the algebra of all bounded linear
operators on a complex Hilbert space FORMULA . Let us denote the subalgebra of
all bounded finite rank operators by FORMULA .
We call a subalgebra FORMULA  of FORMULA  a standard operator algebra
if it contains FORMULA . It should be remarked that a standard operator
algebra is not necessarily closed in the sense of weak operator topology. This is quite
different from von Neumann algebras which are always weakly closed.
From ring theoretic prespective, standard operator algebras and factor von Neumann
algebras are both prime, whereas von Neumann algebras are usually semiprime.
Recall that an algebra FORMULA  is prime if FORMULA  impliess
either FORMULA  or FORMULA . An algebra is semiprime if FORMULA  impliess FORMULA .
Every standard operator algebra has the center FORMULA , which is also the center of arbitrary
factor von Neumann algebra. An operator FORMULA  is said to be
a projection provided FORMULA  and FORMULA . Any operator FORMULA 
can be expressed as FORMULA , where i is the
imaginary unit, FORMULA  and FORMULA .
Note that both
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are self-adjoint.
Combining our current methods with the techniques of {{cite:4e414da4-93e3-43b3-babf-61bb4ab1b196}}, one can get
Theorem 3.3 
Let FORMULA  be an infinite dimensional complex Hilbert space and FORMULA  be a
standard operator algebra on FORMULA  containing the identity operator FORMULA .
Suppose that FORMULA  is closed under the adjoint operation.
Then a mapping FORMULA  satisfies the rule
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA  if and only if FORMULA  is an additive FORMULA -derivation.

We must point out that the technical routes and proving methods of Theorems REF  and REF 
are fairly similar to those of Theorem REF , and hence its proofs are omitted here for saving space.

Related Topics for Future Research
The main purpose of this article is to concentrate on studying nonlinear FORMULA -Jordan-type derivations
on operator algebras. The involved operator algebras are based on the algebra FORMULA 
of all bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space FORMULA , such as standard operator algebras,
factor von Neumann algebras, von Neumann algebras without central summands of type FORMULA .
Note that, unlike von Neumann algebras which are always weakly closed,
a standard operator algebra is not necessarily closed. The current
work together with {{cite:408863de-b533-450c-bb11-5f220f55a4d6}}, {{cite:4a24b1ee-292e-45f1-a962-b6de848eee85}}, {{cite:113920d1-f048-4556-b971-5b6dd08ca2a5}}, {{cite:4e414da4-93e3-43b3-babf-61bb4ab1b196}}, {{cite:6d748fac-662a-4a51-b90a-5ee5acfee64a}}, {{cite:0776f7a6-e3df-470e-a7a5-022b11e6c225}}, {{cite:fab2821c-035c-4af4-8370-57154a4fa43d}}, {{cite:8ca8add1-a51d-4fc8-b46c-be1bbc4b37a8}}, {{cite:4e54635b-6071-41d2-815a-b9a43bbd1afd}}
indicates that it is feasible to investigate FORMULA -Jordan-type derivations and FORMULA -Lie-type
derivations on operator algebras under a unified framework—FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan-type derivations.
We have good reasons to believe that characterizing FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan-type
derivations on operator algebras is also of great interest. In the light of the motivation
and contents of this article, we would like to end this article by proposing several open questions.
Let FORMULA  be an associative FORMULA -algebra over the complex field FORMULA 
and FORMULA  be a non-zero scalar. For any FORMULA , we can denote a “new product" of FORMULA  and FORMULA  by
FORMULA . This new product FORMULA  is
usually said to be FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan product. Clearly, 1-FORMULA -Jordan product FORMULA  is the
so-called FORMULA -Jordan product, and FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan product FORMULA  is the so-called FORMULA -Lie product. Therefore,
it is reasonable to say that FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan products organically unify
FORMULA -Jordan products with FORMULA -Lie products. There are considerable works which are
devoted to the study of mappings preserving the FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan product
between FORMULA -algebras, see {{cite:f298bcc5-e941-43bc-8293-ec83f1c593bf}}, {{cite:061dfbdc-ed84-44f0-9fa2-b3c45177508b}}, {{cite:fddf98de-096c-4d6b-bac3-d3feef2bdd13}}, {{cite:2ee956f0-d704-4db6-ac03-151f2bcf217f}}, {{cite:f2a61a77-0e75-43d5-949e-9640e2decc98}}, {{cite:24cb41b9-f3b2-4c9e-9afd-705541a84cb7}}, {{cite:5d70cd93-b9da-4491-a656-2f4d53f68c62}}, {{cite:e9f4993e-97fb-498b-9d20-abdbeb2bacb2}}
and the references therein.
Let FORMULA  be a mapping
(without the additivity assumption). We say that FORMULA  is a
nonlinear FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan derivation if
FORMULA 
holds true for all FORMULA . Similarly, a mapping FORMULA  is called a nonlinear FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan triple derivation if it satisfies the condition
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA , where FORMULA  .
We should note that FORMULA  is not necessarily associative.
Taking into account the definitions of FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan derivations and FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan
triple derivations, one can propose one much more common notion. Suppose that FORMULA  is a fixed positive
integer. Let us see a sequence of polynomials with scalar FORMULA  and  FORMULA
FORMULA 
Accordingly, a nonlinear FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan FORMULA -derivation is a mapping FORMULA  satisfying the condition
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . This notion is motivated by the definition of FORMULA -Jordan-type derivations
and that of FORMULA -Lie-type derivations. Then each FORMULA -Jordan derivation is a
1-FORMULA -Jordan 2-derivation and every FORMULA -Jordan triple derivation is a 1-FORMULA -Jordan 3-derivation.
Likewise, each FORMULA -Lie derivation is a
FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan 2-derivation and every FORMULA -Lie triple derivation is a FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan 3-derivation.
FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan 2-derivations, FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan 3-derivations and FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan FORMULA -derivations
are collectively referred to as FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan-type derivations.
FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan-type derivations on operator algebras are intensively studied by
several authors, {{cite:408863de-b533-450c-bb11-5f220f55a4d6}}, {{cite:4a24b1ee-292e-45f1-a962-b6de848eee85}}, {{cite:113920d1-f048-4556-b971-5b6dd08ca2a5}}, {{cite:4e414da4-93e3-43b3-babf-61bb4ab1b196}}, {{cite:6d748fac-662a-4a51-b90a-5ee5acfee64a}}, {{cite:0776f7a6-e3df-470e-a7a5-022b11e6c225}}, {{cite:fab2821c-035c-4af4-8370-57154a4fa43d}}, {{cite:8ca8add1-a51d-4fc8-b46c-be1bbc4b37a8}}, {{cite:4e54635b-6071-41d2-815a-b9a43bbd1afd}} .
A basic question in this line is to investigate whether each nonlinear FORMULA -FORMULA -Jordan-type derivation
on an operator algebra FORMULA  with FORMULA  is an additive FORMULA -derivation.
In view of the current work and existing results in this direction, we propose several open questions.

standard operator algebra on FORMULA  containing the identity operator FORMULA .
Let FORMULA  be a non-zero scalar.

FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . Is FORMULA  an additive FORMULA -derivation ? Does
the relation FORMULA  hold for any FORMULA  ?

Question 4.2 
Let FORMULA  be the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space
FORMULA  and FORMULA  be a factor von Neumann algebra. Suppose that FORMULA  is a non-zero scaler.
Let FORMULA  be a mapping such that
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . Is FORMULA  an additive FORMULA -derivation ? Do we have
the relation FORMULA  for any FORMULA  ?

Question 4.3 
Let FORMULA  be the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space
FORMULA  and FORMULA  be a von Neumann algebra without central
summands of type FORMULA . Let FORMULA  be a non-zereo scalar. A mapping FORMULA 
satisfies the following conditions:
FORMULA 
for all FORMULA . Is FORMULA  an additive FORMULA -derivation ? Can we get
the relation FORMULA  for any FORMULA  ?
