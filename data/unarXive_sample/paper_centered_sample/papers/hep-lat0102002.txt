We investigate topology in lattice simulations of QCD with two
flavours of dynamical Wilson fermions. At various sea quark masses
we find reasonable agreement between results for the topological
charge from fermionic and gluonic definitions, the latter with
cooling. We study correlations of the topological charge with light
hadronic observables and find effects in the flavour singlet
pseudoscalar channel. The quark mass dependence of the
topological susceptibility, FORMULA , is consistent with the
leading order small FORMULA  expectation,
FORMULA .

Introduction
One of the most intriguing features of QCD is its topological vacuum
structure which results in phenomenological consequences with an
important bearing on particle physics such as the breaking of the
axial FORMULA  and chiral symmetries.
In the context of pure gauge theories, lattice methods have by
now matured to provide a valuable tool kit for accessing the continuum
topological susceptibility, FORMULA . Various gluonic definitions of
the topological charge lead to consistent estimates of
FORMULA  {{cite:21a34912-1e4f-49da-9d55-6a2f778c93f9}}, and remnants of the Atiyah-Singer index
theorem are witnessed to hold on the lattice: the topological charge,
FORMULA , as obtained after cooling from the gluonic degrees of freedom is
consistent with the fermionic index, as determined from counting the
zero-level crossings of the eigenvalues of the Wilson-Dirac operator,
FORMULA , under variations of the bare quark mass,
FORMULA  {{cite:c7e0c6cc-ba82-4c6a-8227-4457808abbdf}}, {{cite:4207bd8d-dcb3-45d9-88c6-8d645a6500f1}}.
Moreover, one might perceive the very value of FORMULA  as delivered by quenched
lattice
simulations {{cite:1fd2cf3f-36fc-4bb6-b6bf-18e6a1644ac6}}, {{cite:ec0dde80-0e21-4f92-a3ee-a74d8abb7601}}, {{cite:c8bdddec-4a7b-4ad5-992e-1274be59a302}}, {{cite:ca6d3132-4898-47e6-9586-95d6609806bd}}, FORMULA  MeV,
to confirm the lattice approach to
topological properties: it turns out to be in fairly good agreement with the
large FORMULA  anticipation made by Witten and Veneziano {{cite:7815e546-488e-4fc0-850d-91c8ce4a48e1}},
FORMULA .
In conclusion, the lattice machinery appears to work for the study of
topological aspects in gluodynamics.
Unfortunately, however, the situation regarding the
QCD vacuum proper is by far less settled:
for sheer cost reasons so far only the regime of
intermediate sea quark masses,
not much lighter than the strange quark, has been explored.
In fact it is still under
debate whether the data from full QCD simulations support the
expected vanishing susceptibility at chiral sea quark
masses, FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Attempts to verify this prediction via lattice simulations have a long
history. While the first lattice studies in this direction with Kogut-Susskind
(KS) sea quarks {{cite:aad4897c-dc8d-4a26-9936-874f1a6d4469}}, {{cite:b2ee47c1-15cf-44fc-8fd1-2cdc63302129}}, {{cite:23831146-1938-43f2-bae4-375d0d9adce5}}, {{cite:7c9e1885-e979-40dd-a8e9-cd57a1b0f3a5}} could not
reach conclusive results, later investigations did yield some qualitative
evidence in favour of the expected decrease of
FORMULA  {{cite:de0a7e8d-8fd8-434a-89ba-b91b916a5233}}.
Quite recently, this problem has been revisited from three different
sides — but the debate is still open: the
CP-PACS {{cite:022df402-bfdc-46ef-812a-380054467ba7}} and UKQCD {{cite:17a6b02a-83cf-4ebe-b41a-61b4f647e0c1}}
collaborations employed improved Wilson fermionic and different
gluonic actions while the Pisa group {{cite:d9268db9-bc9e-49c5-8439-9605c501a924}} operated with
two and four flavours of KS fermions. A further data point
for FORMULA  KS flavours has been obtained by
Hasenfratz {{cite:1b65fe35-3302-4dd5-ad7c-a869f5fd864e}}
(for a recent review
see e.g. Ref. {{cite:5fb376a2-4aff-4f35-a5e2-eaec2089ace5}}). While both the Pisa group
(working at an inverse lattice spacing FORMULA  GeV and bare
quark masses FORMULA ) and the CP-PACS collaboration (at
FORMULA  GeV, FORMULA ) saw no
evidence whatsoever in favour of the expected chiral behaviour, the
UKQCD collaboration did verify (at FORMULA  GeV and
FORMULA ) a decrease of FORMULA , consistent with
theoretical expectations.
In this paper we shall present an analysis focused on this issue,
based on the final statistics of our SESAM and TFORMULA L samples of QCD
vacuum configurations. The article is organised as follows. In
Sect.  we describe the details of our simulation and
methodology, including a comparison between fermionic and gluonic
definitions of the topological charge. Preliminary results on this
comparison, based on smaller statistical samples, have been reported
by us previously {{cite:682637f5-b1bd-4cb1-8047-69dce9f794e3}}. In Sect.  we
investigate correlations between the topological charge and the hadron
spectrum. Finally, in Sect. , we present the lattice
data on the topological susceptibility.

Determination of the topological charge
Measurements
We analyse ensembles of gauge configurations that have been generated
by means of the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm using the Wilson
fermionic and gluonic actions with FORMULA  mass degenerate quark
flavours at the inverse lattice coupling, FORMULA , corresponding
to an inverse lattice spacing FORMULA  GeV at
physical sea quark masses. This was done on FORMULA  as well as on FORMULA  lattices at
five different values of the sea quark mass parameter. The
corresponding chiralities can be quantified in terms of
FORMULA -ratios, ranging between FORMULA  and
FORMULA  {{cite:bcc96934-3ba6-4eed-a6c7-3446acefc87d}}. The relevant simulation settings are
displayed in Table REF  {{cite:f0bb25c7-c2e8-48dc-80e3-b38ad33460ad}}. At each
FORMULA -value 4,000–5,000 thermalized HMC trajectories have been
generated. In addition to the dynamical quark simulations, quenched
reference measurements on FORMULA  lattices at FORMULA  were
performed. The configurations that enter the analysis are separated
by 25 (24 at FORMULA  and 10 in the quenched simulation) HMC
trajectories.
TABLE 
Lower limits on the integrated autocorrelation times, FORMULA , are estimated by binning the data for the topological charge
FORMULA , FORMULA , into FORMULA  blocks that contain FORMULA  successive measurements each. On each such
block of length FORMULA  an average FORMULA , is calculated:
FORMULA . We determine fluctuations
between these bins,
FORMULA 
where the average FORMULA  is calculated on
the first
FORMULA  configurations.
We then estimate the autocorrelation times,
FORMULA 
that are included in the table. FORMULA 
denotes the measurement frequency. On the FORMULA  volume at
FORMULA , in addition to the FORMULA  time series, we also determined the topological
charge with increased frequency FORMULA ,
with a reduced number of 10 (as opposed to 60) cooling sweeps. The
larger frequency enabled us to compute the autocorrelation time from
the autocorrelation function itself, with full control over
statistical errors {{cite:682637f5-b1bd-4cb1-8047-69dce9f794e3}}, {{cite:134caef0-fb66-4653-b1f3-700d6bc4906e}}. The resulting value,
FORMULA , is consistent with our estimate
obtained in the way described above, FORMULA . We take this as an indication that our
estimates are reasonable. Interestingly, the autocorrelation times
grow both with decreasing quark mass and increasing volume as
already observed in Ref. {{cite:682637f5-b1bd-4cb1-8047-69dce9f794e3}}.
We employ a gluonic as well as a fermionic definition of the topological
charge. In the gluonic case we define a topological charge density,
FORMULA 
where we use the symmetric (clover leaf) definition {{cite:ef7274eb-b203-4a6d-b543-7c72eab12686}},
FORMULA 
and FORMULA ,
which is correct up to order FORMULA  lattice artefacts.
The topological charge,
FORMULA 
should then approach integer values as FORMULA  in the infinite volume
limit, on sufficiently smooth gauge configurations.

Renormalization
In a quantum field theory, both FORMULA  and FORMULA  undergo multiplicative
renormalization. Moreover, FORMULA  requires additive renormalization.
Cooling {{cite:f4f6ebc6-f2df-4356-8c28-da43fa72ebf0}}, {{cite:2da57305-fc09-47dc-b887-5c63b1e4c7e3}} is meant to filter for
(semi)-classical features; indeed, after cooling, both renormalization
constants have been shown to be close to their trivial
values {{cite:21a34912-1e4f-49da-9d55-6a2f778c93f9}}, {{cite:ec0dde80-0e21-4f92-a3ee-a74d8abb7601}}. In the context of this
article we will not investigate properties of the density distribution
FORMULA  itself but rather stick to the net topological charge FORMULA  only.
For this purpose the iterative application of cooling by simple
minimisation of the Wilson plaquette action is appropriate. To keep
the cooling update local we visit the lattice sites in an even-odd
pattern, rather than in the sequential ordering that is usually
employed in the Monte Carlo updating of pure gauge configurations.
The inner-most loop within a cooling sweep runs across the directions
FORMULA , and we carry out 60 such sweeps. In Fig. REF  we
illustrate the resulting numerical pattern of topological charges
which cluster nicely around integer values as anticipated.
FIGURE 
TABLE 
The fermionic method consists of determining the topological charge
à la Smit and Vink {{cite:83713d63-9738-4d92-9f1b-0ff63ebf6b46}},
FORMULA 
that is inspired by the continuum axial divergence relation,
FORMULA . The above trace is to be
taken over Dirac, colour and space-time indices only (not over the
flavours), i.e. FORMULA  for
FORMULA  mass degenerate quark flavours. FORMULA  is a
renormalization constant, FORMULA 
denotes the bare quark mass and FORMULA  is the lattice discretised version
of FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
We determine FORMULA  using FORMULA  noisy sources
with diagonal improvement as detailed in Ref. {{cite:7714d2a6-97e5-4001-9862-3fd998b9c089}}.
On the FORMULA  configurations 100 such estimates were performed
while at all other FORMULA  values we averaged over 400 estimatesApproximating FORMULA  by a finite number of noise vectors
can result in an
underestimated integrated autocorrelation time.
Nonetheless, we find
the FORMULA -estimates
from the fermionic definition {{cite:134caef0-fb66-4653-b1f3-700d6bc4906e}} to be consistent
with the gluonic ones
of Table REF ..
FIGURE 
The renormalization constant FORMULA  in Eq. (REF ) is unknown. We
attempt to estimate the combination FORMULA  from the ratio of the
gluonic [Eq. (REF )] and of the fermionic
[Eq. ())] definitions. We determine FORMULA  using
the critical value, FORMULA  {{cite:bcc96934-3ba6-4eed-a6c7-3446acefc87d}}. The results
are displayed in Table REF , assuming the multiplicative
renormalization of the gluonic definition after cooling to be unity.
The estimates of the fermionic traces are subject to statistical
uncertainties, FORMULA  on the FORMULA  lattices
and FORMULA  – 3 on the FORMULA  volumes. In
addition, both definitions are expected to suffer from different
FORMULA  lattice artefacts. We do not attempt to estimate
the resulting statistical and systematic uncertainties on FORMULA . We
find FORMULA  to be of order one and to depend monotonously on the quark
mass, with the deviation from unity increasing when approaching the
chiral limit.
The correlation between the two definitions is visualised in the
scatter plot, Fig. REF , for the FORMULA  lattices at
FORMULA . While the gluonic data points cluster around integer
values, this is not the case for the (stochastically estimated)
fermionic values. The data of the figure are
normalised such that the points should collapse onto the line with
slope one. Indeed, 137 out of 199 values (62 %) lie within the
one FORMULA  error band. The correlation between the two definitions
is also visible from the Monte Carlo histories depicted
in Fig. REF .
FIGURE 

Ergodicity
In Fig. REF  we survey the Monte Carlo histories of FORMULA  for all
our runs.
These charts provide a gross evidence for the quality of our data in view of
the decorrelation with respect to the topological sectors.
The topological susceptibility,
FORMULA 
should be independent of the volume FORMULA 
to a first approximation. Therefore, the modulus of the topological
charge FORMULA  should scale in proportion to FORMULA .
Indeed, the topological charge distribution on the large lattice at
FORMULA  is by a factor of about two wider than that on the
small lattice. We also observe reduced fluctuations as we increase
FORMULA  at fixed FORMULA . While the FORMULA  time histories
appear to tunnel ergodically through all topological sectors the total
number of tunnellings observed for FORMULA  is not yet
sufficient to achieve a symmetric distribution.

Topology and the hadron spectrum
We address the question whether the statistics presented in
Fig. REF  suffices to expose a significant FORMULA  dependency of
hadronic states. To minimise statistical errors we subdivided each
sample into two subsamples only, one containing configurations
with FORMULA  and one with FORMULA . For the smaller volume at
FORMULA  this division results in two subsamples of
approximately 100 configurations each.
The most interesting test case is given by the effective masses in the
flavour singlet pseudoscalar channel, FORMULA , that should be particularly sensitive to the vacuum
topology. This is confirmed by the data displayed in Fig. REF .
We find the FORMULA  mass on vacuum configurations with FORMULA 
to systematically lie below the corresponding mass obtained with the
cut FORMULA . Note that in the infinite volume limit one would expect
such a sensitivity of correlation functions on FORMULA  to disappear.
For further details we refer to
Ref. {{cite:6cc1bb7f-239a-4e93-a173-ecb56fc0ffef}}.
FIGURE 
In Fig. REF  we show the corresponding flavour octet channel quantities,
i.e. FORMULA  effective masses, where we anticipate no such correlation with topology.
This is indeed borne out by the data: not only at FORMULA 
but time slice by time slice no sensitivity to the value of the modulus of the
topological charge is detected, with rather high statistical accuracy.
The horizontal line with error band indicates the asymptotic large FORMULA 
results obtained from a fit to the entire data sample {{cite:bcc96934-3ba6-4eed-a6c7-3446acefc87d}}.
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
FIGURE 
Apart from the FORMULA  none of the standard mesonic, baryonic and
glueball-like states exhibit correlations between FORMULA  and the
respective effective masses. In Figs. REF  –
REF  we illustrate this for the FORMULA , the
nucleon and the FORMULA . In no case have we found any systematic
effects on the static potential. Of course this does not exclude the
possibility of correlations between hadronic properties and the
distribution of instantons and anti-instantons and their relative
orientations in colour and position space {{cite:74055efd-535f-42e2-a9fe-a56f41cc87f8}}.

The topological susceptibility
In Figs. REF  – REF  we display three
histograms of topological charge distributions. Each bin with width
FORMULA , centred around FORMULA , contains all measurements
resulting in charges within the interval FORMULA , where FORMULA  on the FORMULA  lattice depicted in
Fig. REF  and FORMULA  for the FORMULA  lattices of
Fig. REF  and Fig. REF . In addition to the data we
display Gaussian distributions,
FORMULA 
In Fig. REF  we include the statistical uncertainties of the
individual bins, FORMULA , while in
Fig. REF  and Fig. REF  the error on the width of the
distribution is reflected by the error band around the central curve.

The fitted topological susceptibilities FORMULA  as well as
FORMULA  are displayed in Table REF . For orientation, we
convert FORMULA  into physical units in the last column of the table, using
FORMULA  MeV. The distribution at FORMULA  is not
symmetric around zero anymore, as reflected by the value FORMULA  and by Fig. REF . Therefore, in this case,
the resulting value of FORMULA  should pass with a grain of doubt,
notwithstanding the comfortable error bars. A comparison between the
FORMULA  and FORMULA  results at FORMULA  reveals that
the level of finite size effects on FORMULA  is below the statistical errors.

TABLE 
FIGURE 
In Table REF  we display the
spatial lattice extents, FORMULA  as well as FORMULA 
and FORMULA . We estimate
the (scheme independent) combination FORMULA  that appears within FORMULA 
from
Eqs. (REF ) – (REF ). The topological
charge fluctuations FORMULA  correspond to the average number of
non-interacting instantons that can be accomodated within the
simulated lattice volume {{cite:4afd7cbe-37f1-4ead-954e-0c927c43b4f2}}, {{cite:0c8941b3-92cc-4f37-b49a-6b9ce57ebdc0}}.
It has
been argued {{cite:0c8941b3-92cc-4f37-b49a-6b9ce57ebdc0}} that FORMULA  is already a large volume in the
Leutwyler-Smilga {{cite:dce6c607-31a3-4d9a-b688-9985ce1a454e}}
sense, such that Eq. (REF ) should safely
apply to all but the FORMULA  lattices at FORMULA  and
FORMULA . Even at the latter, more critical, FORMULA -value,
where we have two lattice volumes that correspond to
FORMULA  and FORMULA  at our disposal, we do not
find any volume dependence of FORMULA .
In the regime of large FORMULA  one would expect FORMULA  in
units of some reference scale like FORMULA  to approach the quenched
value as a smooth function of FORMULA . Prior to the comparison with
Eq. (REF ) one should in principle extrapolate the lattice results
on FORMULA  to the continuum limit, for instance along a trajectory of
constant FORMULA . Having only FORMULA  data at our disposal we
cannot yet perform this extrapolation but conjecture that our results
are already sufficiently close to the continuum limit for
Eq. (REF ) to hold. This assumption is plausible in view of the
fact that the topological charges obtained from the gluonic and
fermionic definitions agree with each other reasonably well (with a
renormalization constant FORMULA  of order one) and of our previous
studies of light hadronic quantities {{cite:f0bb25c7-c2e8-48dc-80e3-b38ad33460ad}}, {{cite:6ba061ea-c716-4508-99e3-f6f327713739}}.
For the purpose of the present investigation we shall consider the
dimensionless topological susceptibility, FORMULA , as a function
of the dimensionless combination FORMULA  in order to carry
out the chiral extrapolation. The results are plotted in
Fig. REF , together with the region that is allowed for by the
leading order expectation, Eq. (REF ), for the FORMULA  value of
Eq. (REF ). All unquenched data except for the point at the heaviest
quark mass (FORMULA ) are consistent with this expectation.
Note that the most chiral data point stems from the run with
FORMULA  which, as can be seen from Figs. REF  and
REF , is not of sufficient statistical quality for the
purpose of topological studies. The right-most entry in Fig. REF 
is the result of our quenched reference study.
A linear fit, excluding the largest mass
point, to the parametrisation (REF )
renders FORMULA  with FORMULA .
This value compares reasonably well with the expectation,
Eq. (REF ). On the other hand our data are consistent
with a mass independence of FORMULA  too: fitting them to a constant yields
FORMULA  with FORMULA , in agreement with the
quenched reference point, FORMULA .
Our present study is based on data obtained at a fixed value of
FORMULA  and the quark mass is varied by just tuning FORMULA . It is
worthwhile to relate our findings to those recently presented by the
UKQCD collaborationUnfortunately,
none of the other collaborations
have converted their results into units of FORMULA . {{cite:17a6b02a-83cf-4ebe-b41a-61b4f647e0c1}}
who simultaneously vary FORMULA 
and FORMULA  to change the quark mass while keeping
the lattice spacing FORMULA  fixed in
units of FORMULA . Apart from this they dispose of ensembles
of gauge field configuration of comparable statistical sizes, using
slightly coarser lattice spacings with an improved fermionic action.
FIGURE 
In order to facilitate this comparison we have superimposed both data
setsThe statistical errors quoted by the UKQCD
collaboration are somewhat smaller than ours since no signs of
autocorrelation effects have been found in their
study {{cite:0be44724-b7ab-4170-868b-3692cd763177}}.
in Fig. REF . The data do not clearly
contradict each other, however, we are unable to confirm the decrease of
the topological susceptibility that has been reported in
Ref. {{cite:17a6b02a-83cf-4ebe-b41a-61b4f647e0c1}},
at pion masses within the range of
present-day lattice simulations.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that Wilson fermions are suitable for lattice
studies of topology related effects in the QCD vacuum. We have found
agreement between the topological charge computed after cooling from
the field strength tensor, FORMULA , and the fermionic
definition given by Smit and Vink with a renormalization constant
FORMULA  of order one. The trace has been estimated from diagonal
improved FORMULA  noisy sources. As the next step we plan to investigate
correlations between the topological charge density distribution and
eigenvectors of FORMULA .
The topological susceptibility at FORMULA  has been found to be
consistent with that of quenched studies at large sea quark masses.
Our data at smaller mass values is consistent
with the asymptotic slope in FORMULA  that is expected from
our independently determined FORMULA  pion
decay constant. However, we are unable to unambiguously confirm
the decrease that has
recently been reported by the UKQCD collaboration {{cite:17a6b02a-83cf-4ebe-b41a-61b4f647e0c1}}
with a different fermionic action.
Results obtained by the CP-PACS collaboration {{cite:022df402-bfdc-46ef-812a-380054467ba7}}
who cover a similar range of quark masses on somewhat coarser lattices
do not clearly show this tendency either.
We plan to clarify this issue in
simulations at different FORMULA  values which will enable us to perform
a continuum limit extrapolation, and at smaller sea quark masses.
