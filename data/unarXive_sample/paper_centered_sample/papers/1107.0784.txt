We present a new approach to construction of recursion operators
for multidimensional integrable systems which
have a Lax-type representation in
terms of a pair of commuting vector fields.
It is illustrated by the examples
of the Manakov–Santini system which is a hyperbolic
system in FORMULA  dependent and FORMULA  independent variables, where
FORMULA  is an arbitrary natural number,
the six-dimensional generalization of the
first heavenly equation, the modified heavenly equation,
and the dispersionless Hirota equation.

Introduction
Existence of an infinite hierarchy of local or nonlocal symmetries usually indicates
integrability of a PDE system.
A standard tool to produce such hierarchies is a recursion operator, see e.g. {{cite:e47c7aa0-6cb2-4665-b51f-203460f808bc}}, {{cite:90020da7-a7c2-418f-a4fa-335ea7ce95be}}, {{cite:9a3318b1-da4b-4fee-b1f4-199133b073d5}}. In essence, if one has an auxiliary linear system and a class of its coefficients for which the inverse scattering problem can be solved,
then using a recursion operator
it is usually possible to write down the most general nonlinear system whose solutions
can be obtained using the inverse scattering problem in question, cf. e.g. {{cite:86718fc2-a9d7-4782-8cc9-7925ce9e9f5b}}, {{cite:a6dce22b-132d-4d57-8f27-8f8c1c8e01a3}}.
Recursion operators can be sought for in a variety of ways, depending on the definition
used. For instance, a typical recursion operator in (1+1) dimensions is a pseudodifferential operator which maps symmetries into symmetries {{cite:96cfd41d-31c0-41cb-879f-a106879087f7}} and
can be derived from the Lax pair, see e.g. {{cite:96cfd41d-31c0-41cb-879f-a106879087f7}}, {{cite:0977b2db-a559-4a65-95fe-397fc493bfe0}}, {{cite:a19a0f46-0694-453f-bbd7-133c0daa2af6}} and references therein.
However, these definitions and methods do not immediately extend to higher dimensions {{cite:9a3318b1-da4b-4fee-b1f4-199133b073d5}}. Instead, a higher-dimensional equation may admit a bilocal recursion
operator as introduced by Fokas and Santini, see e.g. {{cite:4811041a-5aee-4034-ae2f-e433d4017942}}, {{cite:ddb07d4f-04f5-4e70-b2f1-b587fa336e94}}, {{cite:6172706d-f46a-4caf-820b-dc229abc710d}}, and {{cite:5fb8c43d-fefb-46c9-8b2a-dc814ba5cfa1}};
a prototypical example here is the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation.
From a different perspective,
recursion operators are Bäcklund auto-transformations of a linearized equation.
They first appeared in this form in several works by Papachristou {{cite:d2fbc009-2652-42d0-a53b-7159484216ad}}, {{cite:8b2ab7e6-d57d-4ee1-b8a0-fedf69bcca3e}}, {{cite:4fd98ee4-452e-4091-9cc0-3166c51195a3}}.
The idea is that symmetries are essentially solutions of the linearized equation
and Bäcklund transformations are the most general transformations that relate solutions to solutions.
However, as pointed out by one of us {{cite:0b81889e-6400-4fc9-8bfc-4d85385915a2}}, the same point of view applies to
Guthrie's {{cite:a297f5f1-d375-423b-b071-cace56a30a3b}} generalized recursion operators in (1+1) dimensions.
Guthrie introduced them to avoid difficulties connected with
the lack of rigorous interpretation of action of pseudodifferential
operators on symmetries.
The recursion operators which are auto-Bäcklund transformations
of linearized systems appear to exist only for
a certain class of integrable systems, which has yet to be
characterized in full generality. Such recursion
operators are closely related to
zero curvature representations whenever the latter exist,
see e.g. {{cite:bc006b95-ef37-4498-b753-5e6596bb7b7b}} and references
therein.
By a zero curvature representation for a system of PDEs FORMULA  we mean
a one-form FORMULA  which satisfies
FORMULA 
on the solution manifold of FORMULA ;
here FORMULA  are the independent variables and
FORMULA  belong to some matrix Lie algebra.
Then the operators FORMULA 
commute and we can define a matrix pseudopotential FORMULA  by setting
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  denotes linearization
along a symmetry FORMULA  (see Section 2 below for details).
For the majority of integrable systems in (1+1) dimensions
the pseudopotentials FORMULA  provide
nonlocal terms of inverse recursion operators, whereas
local terms thereof are, as a rule, limited to zero-order ones at most.
This approach applies to multidimensional systems
whenever a zero curvature representation is available.
For instance, the recursion operator found by Papachristou
in {{cite:d2fbc009-2652-42d0-a53b-7159484216ad}} is easily seen to be of this kind.
Now turn to dispersionless multidimensional systems which can be written as
a commutativity condition for a pair of first-order
linear scalar differential operators with no free terms
(i.e., vector fields) and no derivatives with respect to the spectral parameter;
see e.g. {{cite:6c327285-f3d0-417d-b2a2-70cc0cd3a3e0}}, {{cite:da0418d3-6521-4707-896a-d00f4ada19d9}}, {{cite:606650ec-003f-447f-8a93-0e731df8499b}}, {{cite:45e6f238-f679-40dd-914b-bd4ba262245e}}, {{cite:e94612c0-986f-4cf3-ab41-c344b56d3e6a}} and references therein
for more information on such systems. The systems of this kind are
a subject of intense research as they arise in a multitude of areas from
self-dual gravity, see e.g. {{cite:527a4d8a-f058-4411-84dd-841bc2646770}}, {{cite:112a2302-769a-4a7d-8cdf-105cbe9ee28b}}, {{cite:561dc85e-065b-4080-9479-72339955220e}}, {{cite:e94612c0-986f-4cf3-ab41-c344b56d3e6a}},
hyper-Kähler {{cite:098efd82-2015-41ed-84a3-5692734b5741}}, symplectic {{cite:7e165dca-45ce-4874-ae4f-db662b56f30f}} and conformal {{cite:580db370-20ee-455c-ab5c-e504f2d5cbd5}} geometry
to fluid dynamics and related fields, cf. e.g. {{cite:ddb668e4-3bc8-42ae-b43b-5f7149f25c8e}}, {{cite:b2f720b3-a7c4-4189-9f59-04954908732d}}, {{cite:deccc469-b980-4b9c-a5f3-dafb1ae5588d}}.
Even though the recursion operators for some of these systems
were found, see e.g. {{cite:d2fbc009-2652-42d0-a53b-7159484216ad}}, {{cite:11d366a7-a186-4ca6-98e2-db8f44edb377}}, {{cite:112a2302-769a-4a7d-8cdf-105cbe9ee28b}}, {{cite:45e6f238-f679-40dd-914b-bd4ba262245e}}, {{cite:45cdac1b-8b3b-43c0-bd0f-1aaf8df83098}}, {{cite:561dc85e-065b-4080-9479-72339955220e}},
they were obtained using either various ad hoc methods or the partner symmetry method, both of which can be applied only under fairly restrictive assumptions.
Below we present a method for finding recursion operators
which is based on a generalization of pseudopotentials (REF )
using the adjoint representation of the Lie algebra of vector fields.
We are convinced that our approach applies to a considerably broader
class of dispersionless systems than the methods mentioned
in the previous paragraph. Moreover, our method is also more algorithmic:
given a Lax-type representation for the system under study,
finding a recursion operator of the type described in our paper, if it exists,
is an essentially algorithmic task while
e.g. the partner symmetry approach involves a non-algorithmic subproblem
of representing the linearized equation as a two-dimensional divergence.
The paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2 we present a general
construction of recursion operators
which are auto-Bäcklund transformations
of linearized systems, and Sections 3 and 4 illustrate its application
on the examples of the Manakov–Santini system
and the dispersionless Hirota equation.
Finally, in Section 5 we give a modification of the construction
from Section 2 for the case of Hamiltonian
vector fields and provide some further examples.

The general approach
Let FORMULA  be a system of PDEs in FORMULA  independent variables FORMULA , FORMULA , for
the unknown FORMULA -component vector function
FORMULA ,
where the superscript `FORMULA ' denotes matrix transposition.
Denote
FORMULA ;
in particular, FORMULA .
As usually in the formal theory of PDEs {{cite:90020da7-a7c2-418f-a4fa-335ea7ce95be}}, {{cite:efed1b62-8a03-4ded-a1d8-98c570749f7b}}, {{cite:e47c7aa0-6cb2-4665-b51f-203460f808bc}},
FORMULA  and FORMULA  are considered as independent quantities and can be
viewed as coordinates on an abstract infinite-dimensional space (a jet space).
By a local function or a function on the jet space we shall mean any function of a
finite number of FORMULA  and FORMULA  and their derivatives.
We denote
FORMULA 
the usual total derivatives, which can be naturally viewed as vector fields on the jet space.
The condition FORMULA  along with its differential consequences
FORMULA  determines what is called a
solution manifold, which in general is an infinite-dimensional
submanifold of the jet space. In what follows we tacitly assume that
the total derivatives are restricted on the solution manifold;
these restrictions are tangent to the latter.
As usual, the directional derivative along an FORMULA -component vector
FORMULA , where the superscript FORMULA  indicates the transposed matrix,
is the vector field
FORMULA 
The total derivatives as well as
the directional derivative can be applied to (possibly vector or matrix) local functions
FORMULA .
Recall {{cite:90020da7-a7c2-418f-a4fa-335ea7ce95be}}, {{cite:efed1b62-8a03-4ded-a1d8-98c570749f7b}} that FORMULA  is a (characteristic of a)
symmetry for the system FORMULA  if
FORMULA  satisfies FORMULA  on the solution manifold.
Assume now that the system FORMULA  can be written as a commutativity condition
FORMULA , where
FORMULA 
are vector fields, FORMULA  is the usual Lie bracket thereof,
and the coefficients FORMULA  are local functions that may further depend
on a spectral parameter FORMULA .
Further consider a vector field FORMULA  of the same form, i.e., FORMULA ,
except that we do not insist that FORMULA  are local functions. However, we
assume that the total derivatives can be extended to FORMULA , see below.
The main idea of the present paper is that we
look for an FORMULA  matrix FORMULA 
such that
FORMULA 
are components of a symmetry FORMULA  whenever FORMULA  satisfies
FORMULA 
We shall write
FORMULA  when such a matrix
FORMULA  exists; this is precisely a recursion operator
of the type described in Introduction, i.e., a Bäcklund auto-transformation
for the linearized system FORMULA .
Here and below we assume for simplicity
that the entries FORMULA  of FORMULA  are local functions; however, in principle,
nothing prevents them from being nonlocal.
Note that we do not insist that the vector fields FORMULA  necessarily
involve any spectral parameter,
but we do exclude the case when they involve derivatives with respect to the spectral
parameter.
The condition (REF ) is a system of first-order partial differential equations
in the unknowns FORMULA .
To show that the system is compatible we check the Jacobi identity
FORMULA 
since FORMULA  is equivalent to FORMULA  and FORMULA  is a symmetry.
As a rule, the system (REF ) is not solvable in terms of local functions.
Therefore, strictly speaking, FORMULA  are not necessarily symmetries of the
system FORMULA .
Instead, they are nonlocal symmetries (or shadows in the sense of {{cite:766d6284-cfc1-4b71-81f1-b35059fbb3ed}}, {{cite:efed1b62-8a03-4ded-a1d8-98c570749f7b}}).
This naturally leads to introduction of pseudopotentials (for instance,
FORMULA  and their derivatives) and subsequent extension of the total
derivatives to include the terms coming from pseudopotentials.
To simplify notation we shall, however, denote the extended
total derivatives by the same symbol FORMULA . Note that when
applied to local functions the original and extended total derivatives
coincide.
Note that in a number of examples, where the recursion operators are already known,
e.g. the Pavlov equation {{cite:29891865-505c-4f9c-a2f9-65714491f869}}, {{cite:45e6f238-f679-40dd-914b-bd4ba262245e}}, our method produces the recursion
operators which are inverse to the known ones. Moreover, the inverses
of our recursion operators often have simpler structure
of nonlocal terms; in particular, this holds for all systems discussed
below. Thus, it is often appropriate to invert the operator FORMULA 
resulting from the above construction in order to obtain a simpler recursion operator;
the inversion is an algorithmic process described in {{cite:a297f5f1-d375-423b-b071-cace56a30a3b}}.
Let us also mention that, in sharp contrast with
the case of (1+1)-dimensional systems where one usually can make a clear
distinction among positive (local) and negative
(nonlocal) hierarchies (see, however, {{cite:6dcc8f86-6962-4ccc-924c-d2ee54815b02}}),
the multidimensional hierarchies we have been able to generate
contain, an eventual inversion of the recursion operator notwithstanding,
only a few local symmetries. The same phenomenon occurs for the multidimensional hierarchies
generated using bilocal recursion operators, see e.g. {{cite:ea451a99-eacd-42ba-941b-0c2f71fd2911}}, {{cite:13867049-04dd-4622-a16b-10209b9fffcd}}
and references therein.

The Manakov–Santini system
Consider the Manakov–Santini system {{cite:da0418d3-6521-4707-896a-d00f4ada19d9}} in FORMULA  independent variables
FORMULA , FORMULA  and FORMULA  dependent variables FORMULA ,
FORMULA 
As usual, the subscripts refer to partial derivatives.
System (REF ) can be written {{cite:da0418d3-6521-4707-896a-d00f4ada19d9}} as a commutativity condition of the vector fields
FORMULA 
Assume that FORMULA  has the form
FORMULA 
(no terms involving FORMULA  and FORMULA  are actually needed).
It is straightforward to verify that the following assertion holds for any natural FORMULA :
if FORMULA  is a characteristic of symmetry
for (REF ) then so is FORMULA , where
FORMULA  are determined from the equations (REF ) with FORMULA  and FORMULA  given by
(REF ) and (REF ), that is,
FORMULA 
To emphasize the dependence on FORMULA , the recursion operator given by
formula (REF ) will be denoted FORMULA .
Applying FORMULA  to local symmetries yields
a highly nonlocal `negative' hierarchy of the Manakov–Santini system.
In order to obtain the `positive' hierarchy with simpler
nonlocalities, we look for the
inverse FORMULA .
Inverting the recursion operator FORMULA  amounts to solving (REF )
for FORMULA .
The inverse operator FORMULA  sends
FORMULA  to FORMULA , where
FORMULA  are determined from the relations
FORMULA 
Upon multiplying by FORMULA  and removing the trivial contribution FORMULA 
from FORMULA ,
we end up with the recursion operator
FORMULA ,
which no longer depends on FORMULA .
The components of
FORMULA  are defined by the relations
FORMULA 
The symmetries generated using this recursion operator are complicated nonlocal expressions;
the explicit form for symmetries obtained by applying (REF ) to the Lie point symmetries
of (REF ) is given in the appendix.

Dispersionless Hirota equation
Consider the equation {{cite:f92a795a-c24c-40b8-b9b9-e9cb2ace41af}}, {{cite:580db370-20ee-455c-ab5c-e504f2d5cbd5}}
FORMULA 
It has a Lax pair {{cite:f92a795a-c24c-40b8-b9b9-e9cb2ace41af}} of the form
FORMULA 
where FORMULA .
The vector field FORMULA  now can be chosen in the form
FORMULA .
An easy computation shows that the corresponding recursion operator is given by the formula
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  is a symmetry for (REF ) and FORMULA  is defined by the following equations:
FORMULA 
The inverse recursion operator FORMULA  is given by the formulas
FORMULA 
If we replace FORMULA  by FORMULA , we obtain a somewhat simpler recursion operator FORMULA , where
FORMULA ,
so FORMULA  can be determined from the compatible equations
FORMULA 
Let us apply FORMULA  to the Lie point symmetries, which are FORMULA , FORMULA , FORMULA ,
and FORMULA .
To start with, we find FORMULA , where FORMULA  is an arbitrary smooth function.
Upon having agreed to remove this trivial contribution from the results, we readily find
FORMULA 
Thus, FORMULA  are eigenvectors of FORMULA . To the best
of our knowldege, this is a first known example of local eigenvectors for
a nontrivial recursion operator.
Finally,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are nonlocal variables defined by the following equations which are
compatible by virtue of (REF ):
FORMULA 

The case of Hamiltonian vector fields
If the Lax pair for the system under study consists
of Hamiltonian vector fields,
it is natural to apply the ideas from Section 
to the algebra of functions endowed with the Poisson bracket
rather than to the algebra of vector fields.
Namely, suppose that the Lax pair for the system under study
can (up to the obvious renumbering of independent variables) be written as
FORMULA 
Here FORMULA  denotes the Poisson bracket in question (usually w.r.t. the independent
variables FORMULA  only), and FORMULA  are some constants,
which are typically proportional to the spectral parameter FORMULA .
Instead of FORMULA  introduce a single
nonlocal variable FORMULA  defined by the formulas
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  are some constants which are often proportional to the spectral parameter FORMULA .
Then we shall seek for a recursion operator in the form
FORMULA 
where now FORMULA , FORMULA , are FORMULA -component vectors whose entries are local functions. If necessary, the terms containing higher-order derivatives can be also included.
As an example, consider the following
six-dimensional generalization of the first heavenly equation, see e.g. {{cite:7e165dca-45ce-4874-ae4f-db662b56f30f}}, {{cite:00d58f6d-f52e-49d3-96f6-fda4b07ab43d}}:
FORMULA 
It admits {{cite:7e165dca-45ce-4874-ae4f-db662b56f30f}} a Lax representation of the form (REF ), namely,
FORMULA 
with the Poisson bracket given by
FORMULA 
It is readily verified that (REF ) possesses a recursion operator of the form
FORMULA , where the nonlocal variable FORMULA  is defined via (REF ), that is,
FORMULA 
Upon inversion we obtain a simpler recursion operator FORMULA , where FORMULA  is defined by the formulas
FORMULA 
For another example, consider the modified heavenly equation {{cite:7e165dca-45ce-4874-ae4f-db662b56f30f}},
FORMULA 
which has {{cite:7e165dca-45ce-4874-ae4f-db662b56f30f}} a Lax representation of the form (REF ),
FORMULA 
with the Poisson bracket given by
FORMULA 
It is readily seen that (REF ) admits a recursion operator
FORMULA , where the nonlocal variable FORMULA  is now
defined by the formulas
FORMULA 
Inversion again leads to a simpler recursion operator FORMULA ,
with FORMULA  defined by the formulas
FORMULA 
To the best of our knowledge, the recursion operator (REF ) has not yet appeared in the literature, while (REF ) is a special case of the recursion operator for the so-called asymmetric heavenly equation found in {{cite:45cdac1b-8b3b-43c0-bd0f-1aaf8df83098}} using the partner symmetry approach.
Note that (REF ) also could have been obtained within the partner symmetry approach {{cite:45cdac1b-8b3b-43c0-bd0f-1aaf8df83098}}. On the other hand, the recursion operators for the second heavenly and Husain equations, which were
found in {{cite:112a2302-769a-4a7d-8cdf-105cbe9ee28b}}, {{cite:561dc85e-065b-4080-9479-72339955220e}}, can be easily recovered using the approach of the present section.

Appendix: Symmetries of the Manakov–Santini system
In this section we use the standard convention on summation over repeated indices. The
indices FORMULA  run from 1 to 2, the others run from 1 to FORMULA .
The symmetries of the Manakov–Santini system can be routinely computed as
solutions FORMULA  of the linearized equation FORMULA  which must
hold only on the solution manifold of (REF ); here
FORMULA  stands for the left-hand side of FORMULA th equation of (REF ).
The simplest of symmetries, the Lie point ones, are characterized by the property that FORMULA 
are linear in the first derivatives.
A computer-aided computation reveals fourteen Lie point symmetries for (REF ), namely,
FORMULA 
where FORMULA  each depend on FORMULA 
arbitrary functions of the coordinates FORMULA , FORMULA ; the left-hand-side subscripts indicate the arbitrary
functions these symmetries depend on.
The generators of these Lie point symmetries read
FORMULA 
This notation is to be read as follows: for instance,
the symmetry FORMULA  has a characteristic FORMULA 
and the associated evolutionary vector
field is FORMULA .
Let us investigate the action of the recursion operator (REF )
on the above symmetries.
Obviously, equations (REF ) determine FORMULA 
uniquely up to adding the Lie symmetry we denoted FORMULA 
(we could also write FORMULA ).
Like the integration constants, this term will
be omitted in what follows.
Four classical symmetries, namely
FORMULA , are mapped to local symmetries again:
FORMULA 
The others are mapped to nonlocal symmetries, sharing the same set of nonlocal
variables FORMULA , FORMULA , subject to the equations
FORMULA 
The system (REF ) is compatible by virtue of the
Manakov–Santini system (REF ). Eq.(REF ) determines a
covering in the sense of {{cite:efed1b62-8a03-4ded-a1d8-98c570749f7b}},
but this covering is infinite-dimensional.
Each successive application of FORMULA  requires one more level of nonlocal
variables FORMULA , subject to the compatible equations
FORMULA 
Thus we have obtained an infinite hierarchy of successive coverings.
Upon denoting FORMULA ,
we routinely generate
FORMULA 
etc. If we assign level one to the local variables, i.e., FORMULA ,
we observe that
the sum in the above formulas runs over all homogeneous monomials of the same level.
We conjecture that this pattern holds for FORMULA  with any natural FORMULA .
In terms of these, we observe the following general formula for
FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Likewise, for FORMULA  we obtain the expressions
FORMULA 
Here another pattern can be observed. Namely,
the sum again runs over all homogeneous monomials with the coefficient at each monomial
equal, up to the sign, to the level of the nonlocal variable which is not differentiated. It would be interesting to find out whether
this pattern holds for all natural FORMULA .
In terms of FORMULA  we have the following general formula for
FORMULA :
FORMULA 
Finally, we have FORMULA ,
FORMULA
