1483826223␞␞None␞math9902155␞␞math9902156␞For Multibrot sets, there are new direct proofs of triviality of fibers and thus of local connectivity for all boundary points of hyperbolic components and for all Misiurewicz points MAINCIT .
1483826223␞␞None␞math9902155␞␞math9902156␞Similarly as MAINCIT , the present paper can be read with the case FORMULA in mind throughout, but the higher degrees do not introduce any new difficulties.
1483826223␞␞None␞math9902155␞␞math9902156␞What follows is a brief review of the definition in CIT , simplified using results from MAINCIT .
1483826223␞␞None␞math9902155␞␞math9902156␞In MAINCIT , fibers have indeed been defined using parameter rays at periodic and preperiodic angles, and separation lines through arbitrary interior components were allowed.
1483826223␞␞None␞math9902155␞␞math9902156␞It turns out, however, that parameter rays at rational external angles never land at non-hyperbolic components by MAINCIT , so allowing them would change nothing except possibly confuse.
1483826223␞␞None␞math9902155␞␞math9902156␞As to parameter rays at preperiodic angles, they are simply not necessary: omitting them does not change fibers at all MAINCIT .
1483826223␞␞None␞math9902155␞␞math9902156␞If any fiber is trivial, then the Multibrot set is locally connected at this point; this is one of the fundamental properties which make fibers useful: see CIT or MAINCIT .
1483826223␞␞None␞math9902155␞␞math9902156␞By MAINCIT , the landing points of all the rational parameter rays of FORMULA have trivial fibers.

1483826223␞␞None␞math9902155␞␞math9902156␞Another one is the quotient of the Mandelbrot set in which all fibers are collapsed to points (compare CIT or MAINCIT ).
1483826223␞␞None␞math9902155␞␞math9902156␞We apply the Branch Theorem MAINCIT to FORMULA and FORMULA .
1483826223␞␞None␞math9902155␞␞math9902156␞FORMULA The Branch Theorem ( CIT or MAINCIT ) shows that the various paths within the Mandelbrot set starting at the origin and leading to different points can split only at Misiurewicz points or within hyperbolic components.
1483826223␞␞1640724879␞math9902155␞␞math9902154␞These sets are discussed in a self-contained sequel MAINCIT .
1483826223␞␞1640724879␞math9902155␞␞math9902154␞In MAINCIT , we will use fibers to give a new proof that the Mandelbrot set (and more generally Multibrot sets) have trivial fibers at Misiurewicz points and at all boundary points of hyperbolic components, including roots of primitive components.
1483826223␞␞1640724879␞math9902155␞␞math9902154␞These differ exactly at hyperbolic components: entire hyperbolic components form combinatorial classes together with part of their boundaries, while we want to distinguish all their points; compare MAINCIT .
1483826223␞␞1640724879␞math9902155␞␞math9902154␞We will show in MAINCIT that the Mandelbrot and Multibrot sets have this property: this amounts to showing that they have trivial fibers at the boundary of hyperbolic components (including the roots of primitive components) and at Misiurewicz points.
1483826223␞␞1640724879␞math9902155␞␞math9902154␞We give a general proof here, to be used for Julia sets in Section ; for the Multibrot sets, there will be a direct proof in MAINCIT .
1483826223␞␞1640724879␞math9902155␞␞math9902154␞We will then discuss branch points of unicritical Julia sets: the analog to the Branch Theorem for the Multibrot sets MAINCIT is Thurston's No Wandering Triangles Theorem REF .
1483826223␞␞1640724879␞math9902155␞␞math9902154␞The analogous statement for the Multibrot sets is discussed in MAINCIT .
1483826223␞␞1640724879␞math9902155␞␞math9902154␞It is the dynamic analog to the Branch Theorem MAINCIT for the Multibrot sets, stating that branch points have rational external angles.
1483826223␞␞1640724879␞math9902155␞␞math9902154␞The corresponding statement for Multibrot sets can be found in MAINCIT .
1483826223␞␞1640724879␞math9902155␞␞math9902154␞However, in our applications, this number will always be finite (although not necessarily bounded over the branch points of FORMULA ): for connected Julia sets of unicritical polynomials, three or more rays landing at the same point are always preperiodic or periodic by Thurston's No Wandering Triangles Theorem REF (except for the rays on the inverse orbit of the critical point, but if they are not eventually periodic, then their number can be at most twice the degree); for the Mandelbrot set, three rays can land together only at Misiurewicz points MAINCIT , and the number of rays landing there is always finite.

1483826223␞␞2146102503␞math9902155␞␞1208.0147␞There is a combinatorial proof of this fact (see e.g. in MAINCIT ) which can be adapted to the exponential case once Theorem REF is known.

1977734687␞␞2617009400␞1407.4998␞␞1705.09168␞This behavior is qualitatively similar to our earlier results for quenches to repulsive values of FORMULA , where an infrared scaling of FORMULA extends to larger values of FORMULA with increasing FORMULA MAINCIT , consistent with the dependence of the populations FORMULA on the rapidities FORMULA and with analytic results for the postquench momentum distribution in the limit of a quench to infinitely strong repulsive interactions CIT .

1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞We refer to Section 1.3 in MAINCIT for a more detailed discussion on these applications, as well as references.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞In MAINCIT we studied the classification and non-existence of positive solutions of (REF ) in unbounded domains, as well as the a priori bounds and existence results which can be inferred in smooth bounded domains.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞The core of the new method developed in MAINCIT consists in proving Liouville type theorems for a system of elliptic inequalities satisfied by some auxiliary sub- and super-harmonic functions of FORMULA .
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞However, the proofs of the results in MAINCIT depend crucially on the fact that the second-order elliptic operator in (REF ) is the Laplacian, that is, in the models above only homogeneous diffusion can be considered.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞Our main goal here is to remove this hypothesis and show that the main results in MAINCIT are valid for general operators in non-divergence form.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞It is remarkable that the (necessarily) different proofs we give here not only permit to generalize but also to shorten some of the proofs from MAINCIT .
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞When reduced to (ii), our main results from MAINCIT completed the previous works on Schrödinger systems, by establishing existence results for the case FORMULA , which was almost unstudied.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞Finally, for (iii), the results in MAINCIT seem to be the first on their kind.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞The first hypothesis in (REF ) cannot be weakened, even for simple systems with the Laplacian (see the remark after Corollary 1.4 in MAINCIT ).
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞The system (REF ) is included in the class of systems FORMULA where the main feature of the nonlinearities FORMULA and FORMULA (or their leading order terms) is that they satisfy the condition FORMULA Indeed, we recall the following result from MAINCIT (Proposition 1.3 in that paper).
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞Proposition 2.1 ( MAINCIT ) If FORMULA and FORMULA , where the real parameters FORMULA satisfy FORMULA then FORMULA and FORMULA satisfy (REF ), for a unique number FORMULA such that FORMULA , FORMULA .
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞The first one concerns a coercive inequality and extends Lemma 3.4 from MAINCIT .
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞That lemma for the Laplacian was proved in MAINCIT by using spherical means – a tool obviously not available for more general operators.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞This can be proved similarly to MAINCIT , we include the full proof for completeness.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞See for instance the computation on page 15 in MAINCIT .
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞We set FORMULA and FORMULA It is easy to see that FORMULA is a viscosity solution of FORMULA By the quantitative strong maximum principle (see Lemma REF ), there exists FORMULA such that FORMULA Hence, for all FORMULA FORMULA From this point on the proof is similar to the one given in CIT and in MAINCIT for the case when the elliptic operator is the Laplacian.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞The proof of the corresponding result for the Laplacian in MAINCIT depended heavily on the use of half-spherical means.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞To deduce (ii) from (i) we use exactly the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 2.8 in MAINCIT , replacing the reference to Lemma 3.1 there by a reference to Theorem REF above.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞Observe the conditions (2.6) and (2.7) in Theorem 2.8 in MAINCIT are exactly our (REF )–(REF ) with FORMULA , FORMULA .
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞FORMULA Case of the whole space In this section, we focus on the system FORMULA In our study of (REF ) we always assume that the real parameters FORMULA satisfy FORMULA The last hypothesis provides the following result, proved in the appendix of MAINCIT .
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞As in MAINCIT , in what follows we set FORMULA and we establish a system of elliptic inequalities satisfied by FORMULA and FORMULA .
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞Then FORMULA is a viscosity solution of FORMULA Most of the arguments in the proof of this lemma are similar to MAINCIT (except in c)), thanks to Lemma REF and Lemma REF .
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞We again apply Lemma REF to FORMULA and FORMULA with FORMULA , where we set FORMULA , and obtain that FORMULA is a viscosity solution of FORMULA c) Thanks to Lemma 7.1 i) in MAINCIT , we know that, since FORMULA and FORMULA , we have for some FORMULA FORMULA We also note that for FORMULA and FORMULA , we have FORMULA Hence, FORMULA for some FORMULA (using that if FORMULA , we have FORMULA , whereas if FORMULA , we have FORMULA for some FORMULA , since FORMULA and FORMULA are assumed bounded).
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞[Proof of Theorem REF.] The proof of this theorem follows the same scheme as the proof of Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 of MAINCIT , where FORMULA was assumed to be the Laplacian.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞We consider the following parametrized version of system (REF ), FORMULA where FORMULA and FORMULA are defined as in MAINCIT .
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞We perform exactly the same “blow-up" change of variables as in MAINCIT .
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞Hence FORMULA Next, the exclusion of such semi-trivial rescaling limits is done exactly as in MAINCIT if we observe that the definition of the principal eigenvalue of a fully nonlinear operator (recall Definition REF ) trivially implies FORMULA Thus the proof of the a priori bound (REF ) is concluded.
1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞The proof of the existence part of Theorem REF goes again like in MAINCIT , replacing the Laplacian and its first eigenvalue by the fully nonlinear operator FORMULA and its first eigenvalue defined in Definition REF , also observing that, by CIT (see the discussion after Corollary 3.6 in that paper) that FORMULA We use the same fixed point theorem of Krasnoselskii and Benjamin as in CIT and the proof stays almost identical until the definition of the function FORMULA .

1989629313␞␞2259068315␞1312.1380␞␞1504.05791␞Finally, at the end of the proof, in order to show that the first hypothesis of the fixed point theorem (see Theorem 6.3 in MAINCIT ) is verified, we again argue by contradiction.

2002867407␞␞2161137370␞None␞␞1408.4049␞As already mentioned in this introduction, while the functional FORMULA has been introduced in Shannon's theory in connection with the proof of the concavity of Shannon's entropy power, so that it appears in the related literature after Costa's paper MAINCIT in 1985, in one dimension of space, various properties of the FORMULA functional were considered by McKean in its pioneering paper on Kac's caricature of Maxwell molecules in kinetic theory of rarefied gases CIT in 1965.

2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Similar to MAINCIT , it is assumed that the users are symbol synchronous, possibly have an asymmetric-power profile, and employ CDMA as a multiple-access scheme.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Recall that, in the sum-rate maximization for the single-code CDMA system MAINCIT , a group of users called oversized users are allocated orthogonal signature sequences and non-oversized users are allocated GWBE sequence.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞This view of a multi-code user as virtual single-code users motivates us to rewrite Problem REF in the form of a double maximization given by Problem 3 ll Pmaximize {Smax 12N(IN+12SPST)} subject tol=1nkpk,l=pk,k, and pk,l0, k, l. Now, the inner optimization problem over FORMULA given FORMULA is nothing but the sequence optimization problem considered in MAINCIT for the single-code CDMA system, whose solution can be identified and constructed by using the results therein.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞For FORMULA such that the virtual single-code CDMA system is not overloaded, i.e., the processing gain is no less than the number of active virtual single-code users, orthogonal sequences are optimal and the inner optimization leads to the sum rate FORMULA MAINCIT .

2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞As shown in MAINCIT , a complete orthogonalization of the signature sequences is possible in this case of a non-overloaded CDMA system with virtual single-code users and, consequently, the maximum sum rate is given by FORMULA .
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞As shown in MAINCIT , we first need to identify the oversized single-code users in this case to compute the maximum sum rate.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Note that the direct comparison of Definition REF with the definition in MAINCIT reveals that the corresponding restricted FDMA system with parameters specified in this lemma has the oversized user classification rule in common with the single-code CDMA system.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞In addition, the direct comparison of (REF ) with the maximum sum rate in MAINCIT shows that the corresponding restricted FDMA system has the maximum sum rate in common with the single-code CDMA system.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Note, as mentioned in the proof of Lemma REF , that this definition of the oversized virtual single-code user coincides with that of the oversized single-code user in MAINCIT .
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Recall that, once at least the optimal solution FORMULA to the outer optimization problem of Problem REF is found somehow, the jointly optimal signature sequences can be straightforwardly identified and constructed by applying the results in MAINCIT to solve the inner optimization problem of Problem REF .

2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Thus, combined with the results in MAINCIT , Proposition REF eventually leads to the optimal solution FORMULA to Problem REF as presented in the next subsection.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Especially for the single-code CDMA system, i.e., for FORMULA , the condition (REF ) simplifies to FORMULA which is identical to the necessary and sufficient condition derived in MAINCIT for the optimal single-code CDMA system to achieve the sum capacity of the MAC by having no oversized user.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Thus, the results in MAINCIT can be directly used to identify and construct the optimal signature sequences, which will yield orthogonal sequences for oversized virtual single-code users and GWBE sequences for non-oversized virtual single-code users.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞However, unlike MAINCIT , we have introduced the notions of critically-sized users in this paper.

2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Given an optimal power matrix FORMULA , the inner optimization problem in (REF ) becomes the sequence design problem for the single-code CDMA system considered in MAINCIT , now having the number of active users equal to FORMULA .
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞If this number is not greater than the processing gain, i.e., FORMULA , then, as shown in MAINCIT , a complete orthogonalization of the signature sequences is possible for this non-overloaded system with virtual single-code users.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Thus, FORMULA for all FORMULA , which makes the code design in (REF ) lead to orthogonal signature sequences, which coincides with the result in MAINCIT just mentioned.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Again, the optimal signature sequences for the active virtual single-code users can be identified and constructed by using the results in MAINCIT , which can be rewritten as (REF ) and (REF ) for the multi-code system except that FORMULA is replaced by the set FORMULA of all oversized virtual single-code user indexes.

2003061695␞␞2033617738␞astro-ph0507181␞␞1006.1889␞This interpretation is suggested by the presence of both modes with comparable amplitudes (Fig. 5 in CIT ) and by the fact that for a compact postshock layer the characteristic frequencies of both modes become very similar as shown in Fig. 4 of Ref.

2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞Recently, a proposal to generalize the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger setting to include matter fields has been put forward in MAINCIT , see also CIT , CIT , CIT for further applications.
2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞The construction outlined in MAINCIT amounts to generalize the expression (REF ) in the matter sector by introducing a non-perturbative coupling between the matter fields and the inverse, FORMULA , of the Faddeev-Popov operator.
2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞For example, in the case of scalar matter fields in the adjoint representation in FORMULA , one writes the following action MAINCIT FORMULA where the parameter FORMULA plays a role akin to the Gribov parameter FORMULA .
2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞As it happens in the case of the gauge sector, the auxiliary fields FORMULA develop their own dynamics, giving rise to the formation of dimension two condensates in the matter sector MAINCIT .
2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞In perfect analogy with the gauge sector, taking into account the condensate FORMULA from the beginning, gives rise to a local refined matter action, namely FORMULA which can be proven to be multiplicative renormalizable to all orders MAINCIT .

2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞A similar construction can be performed in the case of spinor quark fields, yielding a local and renormalizable action which reproduces nicely the numerical data on the quark propagator MAINCIT , CIT , CIT , CIT We point out that the mechanism of coupling the inverse of the Faddeev-Popov operator FORMULA to matter fields, as encoded in expressions (REF ),(REF ), is intrinsically non-perturbative.
2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞In particular, we point out the emergence of a non-perturbative coupling between the scalar and the gauge field which is precisely of the kind of that already proposed in MAINCIT .
2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞This provides a first geometrical support to the construction outlined in MAINCIT , while underlining the usefulness of investigating the infrared regime of higher dimensional Yang-Mills theories in order to capture non-perturbative aspects of the corresponding low-dimensional theories.
2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞Also, one should pay attention to the fact that, in the original formulation MAINCIT , eq.(REF ), the parameter FORMULA is an independent parameter which should be fixed by its own gap equation, whose form remains still to be determined.
2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞Nevertheless, it is remarkable that the dimensional reduction of the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger action gives precisely the non-perturbative matter coupling introduced in MAINCIT .
2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞The case of FORMULA is of particular interest due to the fact that the resulting Yang-Mills theory turns out to be coupled in a non-perturbative way to adjoint scalar fields in four dimensions, as already proposed in MAINCIT .
2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞On the other hand, the analysis of the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger action in FORMULA has allowed for a first geometric support for the non-perturbative coupling between matter and gauge fields as proposed in MAINCIT .
2049392102␞␞2511502753␞1408.3597␞␞1608.06979␞More precisely, the dimensional reduction of the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger action from FORMULA to FORMULA gives rise to a non-perturbative coupling between the scalar and gauge fields which is exactly of the type introduced in MAINCIT .
