1977734687␞␞2617009400␞1407.4998␞␞1705.09168␞Numerically it is necessary to truncate the infinite sum in Eq. (), and our truncation procedure is analogous to that described in Appendix A of Ref.

1977734687␞␞2617009400␞1407.4998␞␞1705.09168␞This is similar to the behavior following quenches to small repulsive interaction strengths analyzed in Ref. MAINCIT .

1977734687␞␞2617009400␞1407.4998␞␞1705.09168␞This behavior is qualitatively similar to our earlier results for quenches to repulsive values of FORMULA , where an infrared scaling of FORMULA extends to larger values of FORMULA with increasing FORMULA MAINCIT , consistent with the dependence of the populations FORMULA on the rapidities FORMULA and with analytic results for the postquench momentum distribution in the limit of a quench to infinitely strong repulsive interactions CIT .

2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Similar to MAINCIT , it is assumed that the users are symbol synchronous, possibly have an asymmetric-power profile, and employ CDMA as a multiple-access scheme.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Recall that, in the sum-rate maximization for the single-code CDMA system MAINCIT , a group of users called oversized users are allocated orthogonal signature sequences and non-oversized users are allocated GWBE sequence.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞This view of a multi-code user as virtual single-code users motivates us to rewrite Problem REF in the form of a double maximization given by Problem 3 ll Pmaximize {Smax 12N(IN+12SPST)} subject tol=1nkpk,l=pk,k, and pk,l0, k, l. Now, the inner optimization problem over FORMULA given FORMULA is nothing but the sequence optimization problem considered in MAINCIT for the single-code CDMA system, whose solution can be identified and constructed by using the results therein.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞For FORMULA such that the virtual single-code CDMA system is not overloaded, i.e., the processing gain is no less than the number of active virtual single-code users, orthogonal sequences are optimal and the inner optimization leads to the sum rate FORMULA MAINCIT .

2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Note that this user classification is not affected by the noise level FORMULA , similar to the fact that the user classification for the overloaded single-code CDMA system in MAINCIT is not affected by the noise variance but only by the processing gain and the power profile of users.

2003010976␞2134233838␞2070550050␞None␞None␞1211.6491␞It will be shown that the above definition of the oversized FDMA user naturally extends that in MAINCIT and CIT to the multi-code CDMA system.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Although no direct link has been yet established between the definitions of the oversized users for the FDMA and for the single-code CDMA systems, a similar argument can be found in MAINCIT , which says that the optimal overloaded single-code CDMA system achieves the sum capacity of the MAC if and only if there is no oversized user.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞In the next section, it will be shown that the above remark not only verbally parallels the argument in MAINCIT but also successfully generalizes it to the multi-code CDMA system.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Given FORMULA satisfying FORMULA and FORMULA , the inner optimization problem in (REF ) can be viewed as the sequence design problem for a single-code CDMA system considered in MAINCIT , now having the number of active users equal to FORMULA .
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞As shown in MAINCIT , a complete orthogonalization of the signature sequences is possible in this case of a non-overloaded CDMA system with virtual single-code users and, consequently, the maximum sum rate is given by FORMULA .
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞As shown in MAINCIT , we first need to identify the oversized single-code users in this case to compute the maximum sum rate.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Note that the direct comparison of Definition REF with the definition in MAINCIT reveals that the corresponding restricted FDMA system with parameters specified in this lemma has the oversized user classification rule in common with the single-code CDMA system.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞In addition, the direct comparison of (REF ) with the maximum sum rate in MAINCIT shows that the corresponding restricted FDMA system has the maximum sum rate in common with the single-code CDMA system.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Note, as mentioned in the proof of Lemma REF , that this definition of the oversized virtual single-code user coincides with that of the oversized single-code user in MAINCIT .
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Recall that, once at least the optimal solution FORMULA to the outer optimization problem of Problem REF is found somehow, the jointly optimal signature sequences can be straightforwardly identified and constructed by applying the results in MAINCIT to solve the inner optimization problem of Problem REF .
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Definition 9 The users of the multi-code CDMA system are classified into oversized, critically-sized, or undersized multi-code users, if the corresponding users of the restricted FDMA system with power FORMULA , bandwidth upper limit FORMULA , and total system bandwidth FORMULA are classified as such by Definition REF , i.e., the FORMULA th user is tested by the rule FORMULA and classified as FORMULA Recall that the oversized users of an overloaded single-code CDMA system are defined as the relatively strong-power users satisfying the conditions in MAINCIT and, equivalently, those in CIT .
2003010976␞2047920424␞2070550050␞None␞None␞1211.6491␞Moreover, Definition REF works for all system loading condition, while the conditions MAINCIT and CIT for the single-code CDMA system do not always work due to division by zero.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Thus, combined with the results in MAINCIT , Proposition REF eventually leads to the optimal solution FORMULA to Problem REF as presented in the next subsection.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Especially for the single-code CDMA system, i.e., for FORMULA , the condition (REF ) simplifies to FORMULA which is identical to the necessary and sufficient condition derived in MAINCIT for the optimal single-code CDMA system to achieve the sum capacity of the MAC by having no oversized user.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Thus, the results in MAINCIT can be directly used to identify and construct the optimal signature sequences, which will yield orthogonal sequences for oversized virtual single-code users and GWBE sequences for non-oversized virtual single-code users.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞However, unlike MAINCIT , we have introduced the notions of critically-sized users in this paper.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Theorem 4 The optimal signature sequences are given by FORMULA where FORMULA is the set of all virtual single-code user indexes FORMULA such that the FORMULA th virtual single-code user with power FORMULA is non-undersized, FORMULA is the FORMULA -by-FORMULA matrix consisting of the norm-FORMULA and length-FORMULA orthogonal basis vectors of the orthogonal complement of the span of FORMULA , the sequences FORMULA satisfying FORMULA and FORMULA are arbitrary length-FORMULA sequences, and the sequences FORMULA satisfying FORMULA and FORMULA are the length-FORMULA GWBE sequences MAINCIT such that FORMULA where FORMULA denotes the cardinality of the set FORMULA and the identity matrix FORMULA is of size FORMULA .
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Given an optimal power matrix FORMULA , the inner optimization problem in (REF ) becomes the sequence design problem for the single-code CDMA system considered in MAINCIT , now having the number of active users equal to FORMULA .
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞If this number is not greater than the processing gain, i.e., FORMULA , then, as shown in MAINCIT , a complete orthogonalization of the signature sequences is possible for this non-overloaded system with virtual single-code users.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Thus, FORMULA for all FORMULA , which makes the code design in (REF ) lead to orthogonal signature sequences, which coincides with the result in MAINCIT just mentioned.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞Again, the optimal signature sequences for the active virtual single-code users can be identified and constructed by using the results in MAINCIT , which can be rewritten as (REF ) and (REF ) for the multi-code system except that FORMULA is replaced by the set FORMULA of all oversized virtual single-code user indexes.
2003010976␞␞2070550050␞None␞␞1211.6491␞According to MAINCIT , the GWBE sequences are allocated to the non-oversized single-code users, where it is not pointed out that a set of GWBE sequences may include an orthogonal sequence.
